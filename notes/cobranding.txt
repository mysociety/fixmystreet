Notes on adding a cobrand
-------------------------

Basic steps

Assumes cobrand is for ExampleCom

NB: this is moderately specific to producing cobrands for UK councils

1: copy an exiting perllib/FixMyStreet/Cobrand/ file to perllib/FixMyStreet/Cobrand/ExampleCom.pm
    * Change package name at top of file
    * Change following functions accordingly:
        body_restriction
        enter_postcode_text
        area_check
        base_url
        disambiguate_location - see below for details on this

2: create a web/cobrands/examplecom folder and put custom css/images/js in here

3: create templates/web/examplecom/ and put a header.html and footer.html with relevant html

4: edit conf/general and add examplecom to allowed cobrands

5: restart server

6: on dev server you can append ?_override_cobrand_moniker=examplecom
to display the cobrand. ?_override_clear_all=1 will remove this

disambiguate_location

The results of this are used to provide a bounding box for reverse
geolocation.

There's a script in bin - generate_council_location that takes the
mapit area code for the council  as a argument and generates the 
contents of the disambiguate_location hash.

You can also add a town key to the hashref which will be appended 
on to the end of geolocation queries in order to narrow down results
for popular road names, e.g High St
