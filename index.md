About the FixMyStreet Platform
------------------------------

The FixMyStreet Platform is an open source project from
[mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org) to help people run websites for
reporting common street problems such as potholes and broken street lights to
an appropriate authority. It's been [running successfully in the
UK](http://www.fixmystreet.com) since 2007 (in fact, it works so well some UK
councils use it too), and we're still working on making it better.

FixMyStreet has been copied around the world, and is still under
<strong>active development</strong>. We work hard to make sure it's easy to
deploy, customise, and run in locations all over the world.

In a nutshell: how does it work?
--------------------------------

Users locate problems quickly and easily without worrying about the correct
authority to report it to. FixMyStreet takes care of that using the problem
location and <a href="/glossary/#category" class="glossary">category</a>, and
sends a <a href="/glossary/#report" class="glossary">report</a>, by email or
using a web service such as <a href="/glossary/#open311"
class="glossary">Open311</a>.

FixMyStreet doesn't just send problem reports -- it makes the reports visible
to everyone. Anyone can see what's already been reported, leave <a
href="/glossary/#update" class="glossary">updates</a>, or subscribe to <a
href="/glossary/#alert" class="glossary">alerts</a>. We help prevent duplicate
reports and offer additional features for <a href="/glossary/#staff-user"
class="glossary">staff users</a> working for the authorities who are actually
fixing problems.

Could your location use a FixMyStreet site?
-------------------------------------------

We've written a clear guide for anyone who's thinking about [setting up and
running FixMyStreet](The-FixMyStreet-Platform-DIY-Guide-v1.1.pdf). Anyone
thinking of running such a project **must** read it first -- it explains why
these sites work, and what you need to think about before you start.

If you're thinking of getting involved, we welcome questions about how it
works [on our mailing
list](https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/mailman/listinfo/fixmystreet).
Or, if you're outside the UK, email
<a href="mailto:international@mysociety.org">international@mysociety.org.</a>

There's also the [FixMyStreet blog](blog/) where we post version release
information and other progress reports. And we often post FixMyStreet news on
the <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/blog">mySociety blog</a> too.
