* It must be visible from the public highway, so delivery drivers can see it.

* We will not be able to exchange a bin, box or caddy if the old bin is not available, and you may not receive your replacement.

Collecting your old bin - If you've requested a collection of your old bin, we'll schedule a specific date for our
crew to remove it. We aim for this to be the same day as we deliver your new bin, but it could be a different day.
