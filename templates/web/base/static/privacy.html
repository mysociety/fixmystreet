        <dt>Who gets to see my personal details?</dt>
        <dd>This will depend upon the installation of the FixMyStreet Platform,
who should create their own <code>static/privacy.html</code> template in their
cobrand directory to replace this default. In normal cases, your details will
be passed to the people responsible for dealing with your report, and no-one
else.</dd>

        <dt>What will you do with my personal details?</dt>
        <dd>Another question hopefully answered by the installation.</dd>
