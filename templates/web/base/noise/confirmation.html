            If this issue is persistent or recurring, please read our <a href="https://hackney.gov.uk/noise">noise page</a>, which details what you can do and how we might be able to help you.

        <p>
        We also recommend you record new instances against this report using this site. This will act as evidence if the case goes to court. If you don't add new reports within 3 weeks, we will assume that the nuisance has ceased and your case will be closed and no further action will be taken.

          If the problem persists, you can also complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ApQ43Vh8nz0Xgbwep36kR4Ji9fGWLOIntVqVJ9-Z5t4/edit?usp=sharing">diary sheets</a> so we can look in depth at the times and extent of the problem.

            Should the noise occur between 6.30pm and 02:00am on a Thursday, 9.00pm and 02.00am on a Friday / Saturday, or 6.30pm and 02.00am on Sunday, please contact the out of hours team on <a href="tel:020 8356 4455">020 8356 4455</a>. If the noise is ongoing, we will visit you to try and witness the nuisance (other priorities permitting) and if necessary, take action to stop it.
        </p>
      [% END %]

        <p>
        If the noise occurs at any other time please use this site and check the "I have reported this before" option at the start of the process. Out of hours monitoring visits can be arranged if additional reports show that the noise is regularly occurring outside our office hours. If, at any time we witness noise that amounts to a statutory nuisance, then a noise abatement notice would normally be served on the person responsible. If the noise continues after that, a prosecution would be considered, if we can prove that the notice has been breached. <b>Please note</b>: without witnessing the nuisance, there is only limited action we can take.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you have provided your contact details, we will keep you updated on progress. If appropriate we will update you on our planned course of action.</p>
