<h1>FixMyStreet support for Open311</h1>

<p>FixMyStreet supports Open311 both as a <a href="#client">client</a> (sending
reports made on the site to an external service via the Open311 protocol), and
partly as a <a href="#server">server</a> (returning reports made on the site when
queried via the Open311 protocol).</p>

<dl id="client">

<dt>What is Open311?</dt>

<dd>
<p>In a nutshell, it's an international open standard that allows services to
'talk to' council systems.</p>
<p>As channels of communication diversify, it has become more and more
important that council systems can recognise and accept reports from a variety
of sources. For example, reports may come in via Twitter, SMS, email, services
like FixMyStreet, and the council's own website.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Where can I find out more?</dt>

<dd>
<p>Open311 isn't as widely known as it deserves to be, so we wrote a
<a href="http://www.mysociety.org/2013/01/10/open311-introduced/">short
series of blog posts</a> to explain the basics. And you can find out lots more at
<a href="http://open311.org/">open311.org</a>.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Why does it matter?</dt>

<dd>
<p>If you oversee problem reports at a council, you will of course be concerned
about future-proofing your communication channels in an easy and economical way
&ndash; Open311 gives you that assurance.</p>

<p>You may be interested to know about <a
href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/about/council">FixMyStreet
for Councils</a>, our hosted service which sits seamlessly on your council
website.</p>

<p>We can integrate it with any council back-end system, but if you use
Open311, we charge less. That's how much we believe it's the sane way forward
for council problem-reporting systems.</p>

<h2>Searching</h2>

<p>The following search parameters can be used:</p>

<dl>

<dt>service_request_id</dt>
<dd>Search for numeric ID of specific request.
   Using this is identical to asking for a individual request using
   the /requests/number.format URL.</dd>
<dt>service_code</dt>
<dd>Search for the given category / service type string.</dd>

<dt>status</dt>
<dd>Search for open or closed (fixed) requests.</dd>

<dt>start_date<dt>
<dd>Only return requests with requested_datetime set after or at the
  date and time specified.  The format is YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+TZ:TZ.</dd>

<dt>end_date<dt>
<dd>Only return requests with requested_datetime set before the date
  and time specified.  Same format as start_date.</dd>

<dt>agency_responsible</dt>
<dd>ID of government body receiving the request.  Several IDs can be
  specified with | as a separator.</dd>

<dt>interface_used<dt>
<dd>Name / identifier of interface used.</dd>

<dt>has_photo<dt>
<dd>Search for entries with or without photos.  Use value 'true' to
only get requests created with images, and 'false' to get those
created without images.</dd>

<dt>max_requests</dt>
<dd>Max number of requests to return from the search.  If it is larger
than the site specific max_requests value specified in the discovery
call, the value provided is ignored.</dd>
