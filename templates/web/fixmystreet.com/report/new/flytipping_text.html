You can report cases of fly-tipping on private land to Peterborough City Council, although it is the landowner’s responsibility to clear the waste.

The council's Environmental Enforcement Team can only investigate if there is enough evidence available, e.g. witness statement, CCTV footage, evidence in the waste, etc.
When you report, please state if you’re able to provide any evidence to support the investigation.

If there is enough evidence, once the case is referred to the Environmental Enforcement Team for investigation, the council will mark the report as closed on the system.

If there is no evidence of the fly-tipping being committed, or who the waste originally belonged to, the council are unable to investigate and proceed with your report.
