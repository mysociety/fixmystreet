The area selected is not owned or maintained by Peterborough City Council; therefore, it is not the councilâ€™s responsibility to clear the waste from this land.
However, the incident can be reported to the police by phone at 101 or
<a href="https://www.cambs.police.uk/ro/report/ocr/af/how-to-report-a-crime/">on their website</a>.

If you believe the fly-tipping is providing harbourage for pests such as rats or mice (mattresses, sofas, carpets, food waste),
please report this to <a href="mailto:environmentalenforcementteam@peterborough.gov.uk">environmentalenforcementteam@peterborough.gov.uk</a>.

If you are the landowner, when you arrange for disposal of the waste, make sure you use a
