Unfortunately, as this car is on private land, it is not the responsibility of the Council to remove an abandoned vehicle on this occasion.

If you wish to report this incident to the landowner, we advise seeking confirmation of ownership via the Land Registry through the following link: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/land-registry. Additionally, details of some private roads with developers can be found here: https://www.peterborough.gov.uk/council/planning-and-development/highway-control.

If the vehicle is causing an obstruction of the road or pavement, blocking a driveway, or posing a danger, the police may investigate and enforce. They can be contacted on 101, or you can complete their ASB form online to report the obstruction: https://www.cambs.police.uk/ro/report/asb/asb/report-antisocial-behaviour/.

Note: If you are the landowner and seek support to remove the vehicle, please email us at environmentalenforcementteam@peterborough.gov.uk.
