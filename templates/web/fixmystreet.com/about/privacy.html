<h1>Privacy, cookies, and third party services</h1>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
    FixMyStreet is run by the charity <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Working in the fields of transparency and accountability, mySociety thinks hard and
    cares very much about the privacy and security of our users: the length of this
    privacy policy is one result of that. We know no-one goes through Privacy Policies for
    fun though, so we’ve tried to keep it a clear and reasonably quick read.
</p>

<p>
    We hope it covers everything you need to know, but if you still have any questions
    please feel free to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.
</p>

<h2>What information we collect and how we use it</h2>

<p>
    When you submit a report, <b>we pass on your details, and details of the issue, to the
    council contact</b> or contacts responsible for the area where you located the issue, or
    other relevant body such as TfL.
</p>

<h3>
When you make a report
</h3>

<p>
    When you use FixMyStreet to send a report, you provide us with personal information
    including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We <b>send this information to the body responsible for fixing your issue</b>, as per your
    choice of category and location.
</p>

<p>
    At the same time, <b>your report appears on the FixMyStreet website</b>. Your email address
    and phone number are not published, and your name is only published if you have opted
    to do so.
</p>

<p>
    Some councils use FixMyStreet on their own websites. If you make a report within the
    boundaries of one of these councils (either through FixMyStreet.com or via the council
    website), it will be published on both sites.
</p>

<p>
    FixMyStreet provides RSS/JSON feeds which allow anyone to publish reports on their own
    website or page. Typically these feeds consist of reports made within a specific local
    area, and are published on community or local interest sites.
</p>

<p>
    Note that anything you include in the body of your report will be published in one or
    all of the places listed above, so please take care to keep personal information such
    as your contact details to the correct fields.
</p>

<p>
    We <b>store your personal details</b>, along with your password where used (passwords are
    stored in a format that is unreadable to anyone — including us —  known as a hash) and
    any reports or updates you make, in our own database.
</p>

<p>
    These are accessible only to FixMyStreet administrators who adhere to strict internal
    data-handling policies, and, where a council is a <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/pro/">FixMyStreet Pro</a> client, to council
    staff, whose own data-handling and security policies will apply.
</p>

<h3>
    When you add an update or respond to our ‘has your problem been fixed?’ survey
</h3>

<p>
    When you add an update to a report, or click through from our ‘has your problem been
    fixed?’ survey, we record this along with the initial report and your user data.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Updates are published on the website</b> but not routinely sent to the council except in
    cases where a council has opted for full integration. You may opt to include your
    name; your email address is not published.
</p>

<h3>
    When you subscribe to an alert by email
</h3>

<p>
    We collect your email address, which we store with the details of whichever alert/s
    you have subscribed to.
</p>

<h3>
    When you contact the support team
</h3>

<p>
    Your message will be accessible to our small team of support staff, who adhere to
    strict internal data-handling policies.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Your personal information is never shared, or used for purposes other than those
    listed above, unless we are obliged to by law.</b>
</p>

<h2>
    Research
</h2>

<p>
    We sometimes use data from FixMyStreet, or share it with trusted third parties, for
    research. This data is completely anonymised and contains no identifying details such
    as names, email addresses or the content of reports. Our Research Data Release policy
    may be seen on request.
</p>

<h2>
    FixMyStreet Pro
</h2>

<h3>
    When you make an enquiry
</h3>

<p>
    We collect the names, phone numbers and email addresses of council employees who make
    an enquiry about FixMyStreet Pro, request a callback or join one of our webinars.
</p>

<p>
    These details are stored in our internal CRM. In accordance with your request, you
    will hear from us via the channel which you have selected (email, phone or by mail).
</p>

<h2>
    What happens when you use FixMyStreet
</h2>

<h2>
    Making a report
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        When your council responds to your report, if you have provided us with an email
        address, in most cases <b>their reply will go directly to your email inbox</b>. This
        response, and any subsequent correspondence, happens outside the FixMyStreet
        system, except in the case of some councils which have integrated with FixMyStreet
        so that their responses and auto-updates are published on the report page. If you
        have submitted via phone verification, you may not receive any response from the
        council, depending on how their systems are set up.
    </li>
    <li>
        We <b>email you if someone leaves an update</b> on a report you’ve made.
    </li>
    <li>
        We <b>send you a questionnaire email</b> four weeks after you submit a problem, asking
        for a status update. You can then opt in or out of subsequent status update
        questionnaires.
        You can choose to opt out of questionnaires altogether via <a href="/my">your account page</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        If your report is particularly interesting, our Communications Manager may get in
        touch, as we like to feature notable requests on the
        <a href="https://www.mysociety.org/blog/">mySociety blog</a> (or just
        <a href="mailto:press@mysociety.org">let us know</a> directly!).
    </li>
    <li>
        We only ever send you emails in relation to your reports or use of the site.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>
    Subscribing to alerts
</h3>

<p>
    We’ll send you an automated email every time someone makes a report within the area
    you specify, or when updates are made to a report you’ve opted to follow. The
    frequency of these emails will depend on how large your chosen area is and how many
    reports are made within it, but you won’t get more than one an hour.
</p>

<h2>
    Unsubscribing
</h2>

<h3>
    How do I stop receiving emails from you?
</h3>

<p>
    Every alert email we send contains an unsubscribe link at the bottom for you to stop
    receiving that alert. After the first questionnaire email on a report, mentioned
    above, you have to opt in to receive any further questionnaire on that report.
</p>

<h3>
    Unsubscribing from FixMyStreet Pro marketing activity
</h3>

<p>
    All contact will give you the option to opt out of future emails or calls. You may
    also <a href="mailto:enquiries@mysociety.org">contact us</a> at any time to ask that
    we remove your details from our CRM. Note that opting out may be a better solution
    than having your details removed, as it allows us to keep a record that you do not
    wish to be contacted, and prevents the accidental re-addition of your details.
</p>

<h2>
    Legal basis for processing
</h2>

<p>
    In using FixMyStreet for any of the functions listed above (sending a
    report, leaving an update, email alerts or site registration), we are
    processing your data under the legal basis 6(1)(f) – legitimate interests.
    We assert that we have a legitimate charitable and commercial interest in
    giving people an easy and public way to report street problems, even if they
    don't know who the problems should go to, and in sending them updates or
    alerts. The benefits of reporting problems publicly are that others can
    quickly see what has already been reported, so it prevents the council from
    having to deal with duplicates. It also creates a snapshot for local
    communities, so it's easy to see what the common problems are in a given
    area, and how quickly they get fixed. Other local residents can browse, read
    and comment on problems – and perhaps even offer a solution.
</p>

<h2>
    Retention periods and your right to removal
</h2>

<h3>
    Reports and updates
</h3>

<p>
    Except in exceptional circumstances, we do not delete reports or updates made through
    FixMyStreet. Historic FixMyStreet reports provide an invaluable resource for
    researchers into the quantity and type of street problems made across the UK during
    the years the site has been running. This research can help inform civic planners,
    developers, coders, historians and social scientists, among others.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, <b>if you ask for a report to be removed, in most cases we will instead invite
    you to anonymise it</b>, so that there is no public connection between the content and
    your name. You can anonymise reports singly, or in bulk, by logging in to your account
    and clicking on the ‘“Hide your name” link beside the time and date of your report.
    From here you may anonymise this report or all reports you have made.
</p>

<h3>
    Your personal information
</h3>

<p>
    As well as your report or update appearing on the FixMyStreet website, your details,
    including name and email address, are stored in our admin system.
</p>

<p>
    If you submit a report but do not click on the confirmation email, your report will
    not be sent to the council; however, the report and your details remain in our system
    and are accessible to site administrators.
</p>

<p>
    Personal details will automatically be removed from our database after two
    years of inactivity of the associated account.
    Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you would like your details to be removed from our admin
    database sooner than that.
</p>

<h3>
    Support mail
</h3>

<p>
    If you contact FixMyStreet via our support email address we keep your message for two
    years at which point it will be automatically deleted. This is to aid continuity
    and so that we can view any historic context which may have bearing on subsequent
    support mail, even if members of the support staff change. Support staff adhere to
    internal privacy policies which may be viewed on request.
</p>

<h3>
    FixMyStreet Pro
</h3>

<p>
    If contact has not been made for a period of 18 months, we will mark your record as
    inactive, and will not contact you for sales purposes unless you re-establish contact.
</p>

<h2>
    Your right to object
</h2>
<p>
    The General Data Protection Regulation gives you the right to object to our
    processing of your personal information and to ask us to stop processing it.
    However, it also gives us the right to continue to process it if we can demonstrate
    compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights
    and freedoms. To exercise your right to object, you can <a href="/contact">
    contact us</a>, giving specific reasons why you are objecting to the processing of
    your personal data. These reasons should be based upon your particular situation.
</p>
<h2>
    Your right to access
</h2>

<p>
    You may <a href="/contact">contact us</a> at any time to ask to see what personal data we hold about you.
</p>

<h2>
    Your right to complain
</h2>

<p>
    If you believe that we have mishandled your data, you have the right to lodge a
    complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/handling/">You can report a concern here</a>
    (but do contact us first, so that we can try and help).

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>To make our service easier or more useful, we sometimes place small data
files on your computer or mobile phone, known as cookies; many websites do
this. We use this information to, for example, remember you have logged in so

the cookies and services that this site can use.

[% INCLUDE 'about/_cookies.html' %]

<h3>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</h3>

<p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use
this site. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of its
users and to help us make improvements.

<p>Google Analytics stores information such as what
pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here, what you click
on, and information about your web browser. IP addresses are masked (only a
portion is stored) and personal information is only reported in aggregate. We
do not allow Google to use or share our analytics data for any purpose besides
providing us with analytics information, and we recommend that any user of
Google Analytics does the same.

<h3>Opting out</h3>
<p>You can <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">opt out of Google
Analytics cookies</a>.

<p>If you want to disable advertising-based tracking, you can
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">adjust your Google Ads
Settings</a>, or opt out of advertising-based tracking across a
number of providers in one go using the
<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network
Advertising Initiative’s opt-out form</a>.

<p>Rest assured, we only track usage data for one reason: to help us
understand how we can make the site work better for you, our
users.
