<h1>FixMyStreet for Parish &amp; Town Councils FAQs</h1>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<dl>
    <dt>What’s involved in the set-up?</dt>
    <dd>You’ll complete a short form to provide your details and council logo, select the categories for which you want to receive reports, set up your payment subscription - and that’s it!</dd>

    <dt>How much does it cost?</dt>
    <dd>£20 per month payable via card or direct debit using Stripe.</dd>

    <dt>Can we cancel at any time?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, if you decide it’s not working out for you, you can cancel whenever you like.</dd>

    <dt>How will we receive reports?</dt>
    <dd>Reports will be sent to the email address you provide.</dd>

    <dt>Can reports be sent into another of our systems?</dt>
    <dd>If you need an integration to be set up with a system you are using, or if you require assets to be displayed on the map, please contact us to discuss options.</dd>

    <dt>How do we reply to FixMyStreet reports?</dt>
    <dd>Replies to each email report will go directly into the report-maker’s inbox, and/or you can add replies to reports on the website so that anyone in the community can stay updated. All reports are published on the map so that anyone with an interest can see what’s been reported and what’s happening about the issues.</dd>

    <dt>We’re responsible for some reports in a category but not others, how do we make sure we only receive those we’re responsible for?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If, for example, you are only responsible for some of the street lights in your area, choose a category name that would make it clearer to the user which category they should pick. For example, "Road signs on the estate roads".
        <p>If you or a principal authority is able to provide an asset layer to be displayed on the map to show which assets belong to which authority, please contact us to discuss options for applying this.
    </dd>

    <dt>I’m from a Unitary / County / District / City / Metropolitan Borough level authority – can we set this up for our parishes?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>FixMyStreet’s technology is available to a variety of public authorities, with different plans and pricing available to suit individual requirements.
        <p>If you’re already a FixMyStreet Pro user and you would like to incorporate parish and town council functionality into your service, please speak to your account manager and we can set this up for you.
        <p>If you’re not a FixMyStreet Pro user and you would like to set up a Pro service incorporating parish and town council reporting, send us a message and we can discuss your needs.

<h2>When things don’t go as planned</h2>

<dl>

    <dt>The site isn’t working</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>First, check if your internet connection is ok.
        <p>If there are no problems at your end, please wait a few minutes, and then try again. It might be that we are carrying out a quick spot of maintenance.
        <p>If the issue hasn’t been resolved after a few minutes, drop us a line.
        <p>Please include the wording of any error message you see displayed, which browser you are using (eg Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari), whether you’re on a desktop or mobile computer, and anything else that might be relevant.
    </dd>

    <dt>We’ve received a report that isn’t our responsibility</dt>
    <dd>
        We send reports based upon the category chosen by the user, so this can occasionally lead to something being sent not to the authority best placed to deal with an issue.
        Please let the user know so they can resubmit their report in a more appropriate category.
    </dd>
