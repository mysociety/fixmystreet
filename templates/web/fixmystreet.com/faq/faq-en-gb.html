<h1>FixMyStreet Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What is FixMyStreet?</h2>
<dl>

<dt>Is this a council website?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No, it isn't – but FixMyStreet does send your reports direct to your local
council.
<p>We also publish them online, so that others in the community can read,
discuss, and offer advice where needed.
</dd>

<dt>Then who are you? And why are you doing this?</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet is an independent website, built by the charity <a
href="https://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a>. We wanted to make it easier to
report problems in your community, even if you don't know who those reports
should go to.
<p>So we made FixMyStreet. All you have to do is type in a postcode – or let
the site locate you automatically – and describe your problem. Then we send
your report to the people whose job it is to fix it.
<p>FixMyStreet covers the whole of the UK. No matter where you are, the only
thing you ever have to remember is our web address – FixMyStreet.com.
</dd>

<dt>Do councils read or act on FixMyStreet reports?</dt>
<dd>
<p>They certainly do. Reports sent through FixMyStreet go into the same council
email inboxes as reports sent through by any other means.
<p>Really smart councils <a href="/council">integrate directly</a>, so we can
place report details directly into their systems, saving them time and money.
</dd>

<dt>How can I contact you?</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can use <a href="/contact">this form</a> – but please see whether these
FAQs answer your question first, because that saves your time and ours.
</dd>

<dt>Is there a FixMyStreet app?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes – there's an <a href="">app for iOS</a> and an <a href="">Android
app</a>.
<p>If your phone isn't Apple or Android, try accessing FixMyStreet via your
mobile browser – it should work well.
</dd>

</dl>
<h2>Using FixMyStreet</h2>
<dl>

<dt>How do I make a report?</dt>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Start at the <a href="/">homepage</a> and type in your postcode or a place
name. Not sure where you are? Pick 'locate me automatically'.
<li>Put the pin in the map to show exactly where the problem is, and type in a
description of the issue. Then send.
<li>Check your email inbox for our confirmation mail, click on the link, and
job done.
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>What can I report?</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet is primarily for reporting things which are <strong>broken or
dirty or damaged or dumped, and need fixing, cleaning or clearing</strong>,
like graffiti, dog fouling, potholes or street lights that don't work.
</dd>

<dt>What shouldn't I report?</dt>
<dd>
<p><strong>Urgent issues:</strong> For problems that might put people in
immediate danger, like gas leaks or falling trees, please contact your council
directly – by phone if possible.
<p>We often route problem reports via cleansing services or highways
maintenance departments, so using FixMyStreet for urgent matters may result in
a delay in your report getting to the right department.
<p><strong>Potentially libellous content:</strong> We publish all FixMyStreet
reports online, so please make sure you are not putting yourself at risk of
committing libel.
<p>Specifically, you should not implicate other people, as can often happen in
reports of anti-social behaviour, animal cruelty, parking offences, criminal
activity, etc. If you wish to make this kind of report, it is best to do it
directly – you'll often find that your council has a hotline.
<p><strong>Non-physical things:</strong> For issues such as noise pollution,
barking dogs, fires, missing wheelie bins or missed rubbish collections,
proposals for speed bumps or pedestrian crossings, or complaining about the
council itself, please contact the council directly.
</dd>

<dt>Are reports public?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes they are: when you submit your report, we send it to the council, and we
also publish it on the website. Your council will respond directly to you, and
from that point on, your correspondence is one-to-one.
<p>For that reason, we suggest that you don't include personal details such as
addresses and phone numbers until you are in direct communication.
</dd>

<dt>Why are reports public?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Putting your reports online has several benefits. Others can quickly see
what has already been reported, so it prevents the council from having to deal
with duplicates.
<p>It also creates a snapshot for local communities, so it's easy to see what
the common problems are in a given area, and how quickly they get fixed. Other
local residents can browse, read and comment on problems – and perhaps even
offer a solution.
</dd>

<dt>Why do I have to give my name and an email address?</dt>
<dd>
<p>For a few reasons: firstly, we need your email address so that the council
can get back to you.
<p>Also, messages sent via FixMyStreet go into council systems. In most cases a
full name is a mandatory field, and your report may be rejected without it.
<p>Finally, we find that when users are asked to provide contact details, the
tone of their correspondence tends to be more constructive and less abusive.
<p>We don't publish your email address, and you can opt to submit your report
anonymously – just uncheck the 'show my name publicly' box on submission. This
will mean that your name is not displayed on the FixMyStreet website, although
it is still sent to the council.
</dd>

</dl>
<h2>Accounts and alerts</h2>
<dl>

<dt>Do I need to register with FixMyStreet to use it?</dt>
<dd>
<p>No – you can send a report without registering. When you submit your report,
we'll send you an email with a confirmation link.
<p>If you use FixMyStreet a lot, you can avoid this step by creating an
account. Once you've signed in, your reports will be sent as soon as you click
'submit'.
<p>You'll also be able to see all previous reports you've made on one page.
</dd>

<dt>How do I register?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Visit <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/auth">https://www.fixmystreet.com/auth</a>
and choose 'No, let me sign in by email'. You can choose a password at that
point.
</dd>

<dt>I've forgotten my password/I want to change my password</dt>
<dd>
<p>As above – visit <a
href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/auth">https://www.fixmystreet.com/auth</a>
and choose 'No, let me sign in by email' - then put your new password in the
box.
</dd>

<dt>I want to change my email address</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>, giving both your old address and
your new one, and we will do it for you.
</dd>

<dt>What are alerts?</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet lets you sign up to receive an email every time someone reports
a problem in your chosen area – visit <a
href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/alert">https://www.fixmystreet.com/alert</a>
to see what's available. This is a free service.
</dd>

<dt>I want to stop receiving alerts</dt>
<dd>
<p>There is an unsubscribe link at the end of every alert email – please click
on this and you'll be immediately unsubscribed.
</dd>

</dl>
<h2>When things don't go as planned</h2>
<dl>

<dt>The site isn't working</dt>
<dd>
<p>First, check your internet connection is ok. You may also like to check our
<a href="https://twitter.com/fixmystreet">Twitter feed</a>, where we announce
any known issues or downtime.
<p>If there are no problems at your end or ours, please wait a few minutes, and
then try again.
<p>If you still can't get things to work, <a href="/contact">drop us a line</a>.
<p>Please include the wording of any error message you see displayed, which
browser you are using (eg Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari), whether you're
on a desktop or mobile computer, and anything else that might be relevant.
</dd>

<dt>FixMyStreet doesn't recognise my postcode</dt>
<dd>
<p>Our postcode data comes from Ordnance Survey. If you have a relatively new
postcode, it may not yet be reflected on OS, and therefore on FixMyStreet.
<p>It's ok though, you can still use the site: just enter a nearby place name,
street name or let the site locate you automatically, instead. You can use the
pan and zoom controls at the top right hand corner of the screen to zero in on
the precise location.
</dd>

<dt>My street isn't on your map</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet's default maps are from Ordnance Survey, so updates to our maps
happen when OS refresh their own data.
<p>You may like to try the OpenStreetMap version of FixMyStreet, which can be
found at <a href="http://osm.fixmystreet.com/">http://osm.fixmystreet.com/</a>
– it has exactly the same functionality, but displays OSM maps.
<p>If you still can't see the street you want to make a report on, your best
bet is to describe the problem location in as much detail as possible, as well
as using the map to pinpoint it.
<p>Ordnance Survey will accept requests for amendments to their maps: contact
them on customerservices@ordnancesurvey.co.uk or via the post to Ordnance
Survey, Adanac Drive, Southampton, SO16 0AS or telephone 08456 05 05 05.
</dd>

<dt>There are too many pins on the map; I can't make a report</dt>
<dd>
<p>Use the buttons at the bottom right of the screen – 'hide pins', or 'hide
old pins', to clear the map.
</dd>

<dt>There's no category for what I want to report</dt>
<dd>
<p>The categories on FixMyStreet are set by each individual council, and
reflect the problems that they are able to deal with.
<p>There is almost always an 'other' option, but if your problem doesn't fit
neatly into any of the given categories, please consider whether FixMyStreet is
the appropriate place to report it (see "What can I report?", above).
</dd>

<dt>I haven't received a confirmation email</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please check your spam folder – this is the most common reason that
confirmation emails cannot be found.
<p>Unfortunately, it is hard for us to avoid from our end, but by adding us to
your email whitelist, you will prevent this happening in future.
</dd>

<dt>You sent my report to the wrong place</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please check that you placed your pin correctly, and chose the right
category for your report. If your problem is very near a council boundary, it
is easy to place the pin on the wrong side of it by mistake. Similarly,
choosing the wrong category can mean that your report is sent to one council
when it should have gone to another.
<p>At the moment, FixMyStreet does not send reports to the Highways Agency
(except within London), but we are working on that.
<p>If the above two paragraphs do not apply, please <a href="/contact">drop us
a line</a> and we'll try to get to the bottom of why your report has been
misrouted. Please include the URL (web address) of your FixMyStreet report.
</dd>

<dt>I want to update my report</dt>
<dd>
<p>If you've already submitted your report, but now you need to send further
information to your council, you should wait until they reply to you, and then
respond to their communication directly.
<p>You can also leave an update on your FixMyStreet report page, but note that
updates are not forwarded to the council. They are intended as a place for
residents to discuss local problems and offer advice or support.
<p>With this in mind, you may wish to both update your report on the site, and
contact your council via email.
</dd>

<dt>I want to edit my report</dt>
<dd>
<p>It's not possible to edit a report once it has been sent to the council.
However, if you have a good reason for editing the text on the website (for
example, you have included your phone number by mistake, or you intended your
report to be anonymous) <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we will edit it
for you.
<p>Please include the URL (web address) of your FixMyStreet report when you
contact us.
<p>Note that edits on the site are not sent to the council, so if your edit is
vital to the problem being fixed, please respond to your council when they
reply to your initial report.
<p>We cannot alter the position of a pin once it has been placed.
</dd>

<dt>I do not wish to make a public report</dt>
<dd>
<p>All reports made through FixMyStreet are published online. Reports can be
submitted anonymously: just check the box when you fill in the form. Note that
the body of your report will still appear on the FixMyStreet website, but
without your name attached to it, and that your name will still be sent to the
council.
<p>If your report contains potentially sensitive material, such as names or
addresses, we suggest that you do not include these until the council has
replied to you directly and you are in one-to-one contact.
<p>If your report is not suitable for publication, you should contact your
council directly, via the contact details given on their own website.
</dd>

<dt>I've seen an inappropriate report/comment </dt>
<dd>
<p>There's a 'report abuse' button at the foot of every FixMyStreet report.
Please click on this and we'll take a look as soon as we can.
<p>If the report or comment is contravening our terms of use, we'll take it
down.
</dd>

</dl>
<h2>What now?</h2>
<dl>

<dt>My problem hasn't been fixed, what do I do now?</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet is great for reporting problems, but we don't fix them – your
council oversees that.
<p>If you'd like to chase your council, try replying to their most recent
correspondence to you – or if you only have an auto-response, you may be able
to find further contact details there.
<p>If you still have no joy, we suggest starting a new FixMyStreet report. You
may also like to use another useful mySociety website, <a
href="https://www.writetothem.com/">WriteToThem.com</a>, to contact your local
councillors and ask them to help.
</dd>

<dt>Someone has marked my problem was fixed, but it isn't</dt>
<dd>
<p>As the owner of your report on FixMyStreet, you can change its status back
to 'not fixed' at any time. Go to your report's web page and check the box
under 'update'.
</dd>

<dt>My report is old and my problem has been fixed. Can I now delete it?</dt>
<dd>
<p>We currently have a policy of retaining all FixMyStreet reports: we believe
they contribute a useful historic picture of communities across the country.
They've even been used in academic research, to study, for example, what the
common problems are in an area, or how potholes are distributed across the
country.
<p>As new reports are made, older ones drop off the first page for any given
area, and are less likely to be discovered by those visiting the site.
</dd>

</dl>
<h2>For councils</h2>
<dl>

<dt>Where do you send FixMyStreet reports?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Drop us a line, and we'll send you a list of the categories we hold for your
council, and the email addresses we have for each of them.
<p>We are happy to make any changes that you require. We can also add or remove
categories if you wish.
</dd>

<dt>How do we reply to a FixMyStreet report?</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet reports usually come by email. If you reply to the email in your
normal way, your response will go directly into the user's inbox.
<p>Your reply is not published on the FixMyStreet website (unless you are a
FixMyStreet for Councils customer who has chosen this option – see 'Can
FixMyStreet connect directly with council systems?', below).
</dd>

<dt>Our council already has its own reporting system – we don't also need to be on FixMyStreet</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet is designed to work in tandem with council offerings. We do not
intend to replace them, and we believe that there's a place for both systems.
<p>Your residents should be able to make reports wherever they choose. That
might well be on the council website. It might equally be via Twitter,
Facebook, or on FixMyStreet.
<p>Many residents prefer FixMyStreet because it's easy to find – they don't
have to navigate through a council website to find it. Nor do they have to know
<em>which</em> council website they should be looking at. And we've made
FixMyStreet about as easy to use as possible.
</dd>

<dt>FixMyStreet does not include all the data we need in its reports</dt>
<dd>
<p>Please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> and let us know what is missing.
<p>FixMyStreet routinely includes the following information in its reports:
<ul>
<li>User's name, email address, and, if given, phone number
<li>Report category [you, the council, may dictate these]
<li>Report title and description
<li>Easting &amp; northing, latitude &amp; longitude
<li>Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by Bing Maps)
<li>Nearest postcode to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated)
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Can FixMyStreet connect directly with council systems?</dt>
<dd>
<p>Yes – and we will do so for free, if you adhere to the Open 311 standard.
<a href="/open311">Find out more here</a>.
</dd>

<dt>FixMyStreet is better than our own reporting system</dt>
<dd>
<p>Then why not replace it with FixMyStreet? We now offer a <a
href="/council">complete fault-reporting solution for councils</a>, that
integrates with your own website.
<p>It has all the benefits of FixMyStreet's focus on usability, and is a
robust, economical, cloud-based option.

<h2>Feedback and ideas</h2>
<dl>

<dt>FixMyStreet really works</dt>
<dd>
<p>Good, we are glad to hear it! It is always heartening to know that the site
is working for people.
<p>If you'd like to show your appreciation, why not <a
href="https://www.mysociety.org/donate/">make a donation</a> to help us keep
running? Or, if you can't spare anything just at the moment, you can still help
us out, just by spreading the word. Tell your friends, write to the local
newspaper, put a message up in your library. It all helps.
</dd>

<dt>I'd like to make a FixMyStreet for my own country or town</dt>
<dd>
<p>FixMyStreet runs on open-source code, so that's fine.
<a href="http://fixmystreet.org/">Read more here</a>.
</dd>

<dt>I want to suggest an improvement</dt>
<dd>
<p><a href="/contact">Drop us a line</a>, or open a ticket on <a
href="https://github.com/mysociety/fixmystreet/issues">GitHub</a> (requires
registration). We value your suggestions and we do act on the most requested or
sensible ones.
</dd>

<dt>I've got an idea for a site</dt>
<dd>
<p>We're happy to hear it – although, note that our parent organisation,
mySociety, tends to have its priorities mapped out for the foreseeable future
and we're unlikely to be able to build it for you.
<p>FixMyStreet code is open source, so you are more than welcome to have a play
around with it.
<p>If you lack technical skills, why not post your idea on the
<a href="">mySociety mailing list</a>? It's full of people with a shared
enthusiasm for this kind of thing, and if you capture someone's imagination,
they may be happy to collaborate.
