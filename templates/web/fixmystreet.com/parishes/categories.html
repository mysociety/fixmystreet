Thanks! We've included a map of your boundary here, to confirm we've found the right one.
</p>

<p>
The next step is to pick what things you would like to receive reports about.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps you are responsible for all grass cutting within your area, in which case you could have a "Grass cutting" category.
Or perhaps you look after a particular playing field, so a "Lifford Lane playing field" category could work for that.

[% IF category_groups.size %]
<p>To help, below we list the existing higher-tier council categories currently covering your area, so you can see how
your categories could fit in alongside them:
</p>

<ul class='parish-category-list'>
    [%~ FOREACH group IN category_groups ~%]
        [% IF group.name %]
            <li>[% group.name %]
            <ul>
        [% END %]
        [%~ FOREACH cat IN group.categories ~%]
            [% NEXT IF cat.category_display == '-- Pick a category --' %]
            <li>[% cat.category_display %]
        [%~ END ~%]
        [% IF group.name %]</ul>[% END %]
    [% END %]
</ul>
[% END %]

<p>
If you have devolved responsibility for something in your area - say you look after
all the road signs, but there already is a road signs category - then you can have a
category of the same name, and within your boundary you will take precedence
and receive reports in that category.
</p>

<p>If you are only responsible for some of the street lights, choose a category name
that would make it clearer to the user which category they should pick. For example,
"Road signs on the estate roads".

<p>
As a couple of examples:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Bridgwater Town Council</strong> in Somerset is responsible for a wide array of things within their area &ndash; their categories include Dog fouling, Flytipping, Graffiti, Grass cutting, Litter/dog bins, Parks, Street lighting in parks, Trees in parks (not roads), and Weed growth.
    <li><strong>Adstock Parish Council</strong> in Buckinghamshire is responsible for Flyposting, Grass cutting, Hedge problem, Dirty signs and Unauthorised signs.
</ul>

<p>We understand each parish/town council is different, and you have the freedom
to pick what categories work for you. Please add the categories you would like below:</p>
