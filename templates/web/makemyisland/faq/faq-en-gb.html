        <dd>Here&rsquo;s our <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</dd>

        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>After choosing the right area (currently we're just running the 
          project on Fonadhoo), you'll see a map of that area. You can view
          problems already reported in that area, or report ones of your own
          simply by clicking on the map at the location of
          the problem.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>They are reported to the [% IF !c.cobrand.is_council %]relevant[% END %] council by email.
          The council can then resolve the problem the way they normally would.
          Alternatively, you can discuss the problem on the website with others, and
          then together lobby the council to fix it, or fix it directly yourselves.</dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes. MakeMyIsland is being supported by 
          <a hrfe="http://www.undp.org">UNDP</a> locally, with help from
          <a href="http://www.mysociety.org">mySociety</a> who provide the
          <a href="http://fixmystreet.org">FixMyStreet platform</a> that's powering
          this site.
