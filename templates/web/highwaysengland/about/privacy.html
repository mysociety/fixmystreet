<p>
    This site is a service provided to [% c.cobrand.council_name %] by
    <a href="https://www.societyworks.org/">SocietyWorks Ltd</a>, a limited
    company (05798215). SocietyWorks is a trading subsidiary of mySociety, a
    registered charity in England and Wales (1076346), who also run the
    national <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/">fixmystreet.com</a> website

    [% c.cobrand.council_name %] administrators.

</p>

<p>
    FixMyStreet provides RSS/JSON feeds, accessible from both fixmystreet.com

    <strong>Note that</strong> anything you include in the body of your report
    will be published in one or all of the places listed above, so

    Research
</h2>

<p>
    mySociety sometimes use report data, or share it with trusted third
    parties, for research. This data is completely anonymised and contains
    <strong>no identifying details</strong> such as names, email addresses or
    the content of reports. mySociety’s Research Data Release policy may be
    seen <a href="mailto:research@mysociety.org">on request to them</a>.
</p>

<h2>
    Legal basis for processing
</h2>

<p>
    In using FixMyStreet for any of the functions listed above (sending a
    report, leaving an update, email alerts or site registration), your data is
    processed by both [% c.cobrand.council_name %] and mySociety.
</p>
<p>
    [% c.cobrand.council_name %] is the data controller and mySociety is a data
    processor.
</p>
<p>
    Your data is processed by [% c.cobrand.council_name %] under the legal
    basis 6(1)(e) – <strong>public task</strong>. [% c.cobrand.council_name %]
    asserts that the processing of users’ personal information is necessary for
    us to perform a task in the public interest or for our official functions,
    and the task or function has a clear basis in law. Our obligation to keep
    highways in good order and to keep public areas safe and functional are set
    in law.
</p>

<p>
    mySociety also runs a service called FixMyStreet. If you report a problem
    that [% c.cobrand.council_name %] is responsible for directly on
    FixMyStreet, rather than this site, mySociety will share your report (and
    personal details if provided) with us.
</p>

<p>
    This sharing is in accordance with the FixMyStreet
    <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/faq">terms of service</a> and their
    <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/about/privacy">privacy statement</a>.

<h2>
    Retention periods and your right to removal
</h2>

<h3>
    Reports and updates
</h3>

<p>
    Except in exceptional circumstances, reports or updates made through this site
    or FixMyStreet are not deleted. Historic reports provide an invaluable resource for
    researchers into the quantity and type of street problems made across the UK during
    the years the site has been running. This research can help inform civic planners,
    developers, coders, historians and social scientists, among others.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, <b>if you ask for a report to be removed, in most cases you will instead be
    invited to anonymise it</b>, so that there is no public connection between the content and
    your name. You can anonymise reports singly, or in bulk, by logging in to your account
    on either this site or on fixmystreet.com and clicking on the ‘“Hide your
    name” link beside the time and date of your report. From here you may
    anonymise this report or all reports you have made.
</p>

<p>
    If you do not already have an account, it is simple to register, and once
    you have done so you will have access to all the reports you have made
    under that email address.
</p>

<p>
    Changes you make to your reports will apply immediately on this site, on
    fixmystreet.com and will also be reflected, sometimes with a delay,
    anywhere else they appear (see “What information we collect and how we use
    it”, above, for more details about where reports are published). If you do
    not see the changes, please ‘hard refresh’ your browser by eg pressing the
    Ctrl and F5 keys simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
    Search engines such as Google often take a little time to reflect changes
    to content, but anonymising your report should also remove your name from
    their search results once the pages have been recrawled by their robots.
</p>

<h2>
    Your right to object
</h2>
<p>
    The General Data Protection Regulation gives you the right to object to our
    processing of your personal information and to ask us to stop processing it.

    compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights
    and freedoms. To exercise your right to object, you can <a href="/contact">
    contact us</a>, giving specific reasons why you are objecting to the processing of
    your personal data. These reasons should be based upon your particular situation.

<p>
    You may <a href="/contact">contact us</a> at any time to ask to see what
    personal data we hold about you.
</p>

<h2>
    Your right to complain
</h2>

<p>
    If you believe that we have mishandled your data, you have the right to
    lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.
    <a href="https://ico.org.uk/concerns/handling/">You can report a concern here</a>
