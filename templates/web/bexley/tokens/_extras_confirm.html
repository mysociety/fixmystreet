    <strong>While we find ourselves in these unprecedented times.</strong>
    All issues reported on Bexley’s FixMyStreet system will continue to be
    actioned to keep our roads safe for critical workers to be able to continue
    to support the London Borough of Bexley and its residents. We may take
    longer to respond to you while we concentrate on getting issues resolved in
    priority order and within available resources. Non-urgent defects may also
    take longer than normal to fix. We will continue to serve you the best that
    we can but urge everyone not to make journeys unless absolutely necessary
    and not report to anything that is not urgent. Thank you for
    your&nbsp;understanding.
