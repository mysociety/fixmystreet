<h3>Effects of cancellation, including reimbursement (if applicable)</h3>

If you decide to cancel the service during the cancellation period, you will automatically be issued with a full refund. However, if you decide to cancel the service after the cancellation period, no reimbursement will be provided (unless we have breached any terms of this contract).
<br><br>
To meet the cancellation deadline, you are required to send notification of your decision to cancel, ensuring that it is received by us (The London Borough of Bexley) before the cancellation period has expired.
<br><br>
We will make the reimbursement without undue delay, and not later than 14 days after the day on which we are informed about your decision to cancel this contract.
<br><br>
We will make the reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise.
<br><br>
Your decision to cancel your existing service agreement will not affect your right to apply for a new service agreement in the future, however we reserve the right to charge £20 for the bin removal/delivery costs if you do so within a period of 6 months.
