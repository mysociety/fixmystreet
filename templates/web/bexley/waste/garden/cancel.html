  <h2>Terms and conditions</h2>
  <h3>Customers’ right to cancel the Service</h3>
  <p>
    Cancellation can be made by completing this form.
  </p>
  <p>
    If purchasing the Service for the first time, the customer has 14 calendar days from the day after they sign up for a membership to cancel the Service and receive a full refund, unless a bin has been delivered when a £20 bin delivery/removal charge will be deducted.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may leave the service at any time by notifying the London Borough of Bexley who will collect your empty bin within 10 calendar days. However, if you wish to cancel this contract outside of the 14 calendar days of original sign up date, then unless we are in breach of any of its terms we have the right to retain all of the annual fee as a contribution towards any losses or costs that we incur as a result of your cancellation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Direct Debit customers must cancel the service at least 7 days before their next payment is due to ensure that it is stopped in time. Failure to cancel the service may incur additional charges. Please ensure that your Direct Debit is cancelled with your bank.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your decision to cancel your existing service agreement will not affect your right to apply for a new service agreement in the future, however we reserve the right to charge £20 for the bin removal/delivery costs if you do so within 6 months of your cancellation date.
