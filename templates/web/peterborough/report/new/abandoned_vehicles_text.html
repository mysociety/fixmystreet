Unfortunately, as this vehicle is abandoned on private land it will be the responsibility of the landowner to arrange a request for removal.

Peterborough City Council Enforcement Team can remove abandoned vehicles on private land if requested by the landowner or the vehicle is in a dangerous state of repair. The landowner does not have to report it to the council to remove an abandoned vehicle on their land, they can take private action to remove it.

If you are not the landowner, the landowner or developersâ€™ details can be obtained from the Land Registry:

If your are the land owner and wish to proceed, we can then log this, and a consent form will be posted to you to complete. If the vehicle is in a dangerous condition please proceed and provide details of the vehicle condition.

If there is an obstruction of the road or pavement or blocking drive or any dangerous parking, this is the responsibility of the police to investigate and enforce. They can be contacted on 101 or you can complete their ASB form online to report the obstruction - https://www.cambs.police.uk/ro/report/asb/asb/report-antisocial-behaviour/
