    <p>Please leave your bin at the collection point. We normally collect
    missed bins within 3 working days. However, due to ongoing staff issues
    caused by Covid-19, staff sickness and the current national driver and
    worker shortage, there will be unavoidable service disruption so we are
    currently unable to confirm your recollection date. We would like to
