 <p>When you report a spillage or a bin not returned, the issue will be recorded and used in our reporting to improve our service.

<p>If the spillage is on a public highway, you can report a street cleaning issue to have it removed.

<p>If your bin has not been returned, we can only come back to return your bin to the correct location if you are on assisted collections.
