</p>

<p>
    If you use this site to report issues it wasn’t designed for, there may be
    a delay in your report getting to the right department.
</p>

<p>
    Also: remember that all reports are published online, so it’s not a good
    idea to use it for any issue that requires the inclusion of people’s
    personal information, like names, addresses, photos of people, or car
    number plates.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Where do my reports go?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    This site is an official street fault reporting system for
    [% c.cobrand.council_name %].
</p>

<p>
    Your report will go directly to the department responsible for getting it
    fixed, or, if it’s not our responsibility, will be routed to the relevant
    body. Reports are also published online for others to see.
</p>

<p>
    The system is provided by SocietyWorks, and operates in tandem with their
    nationwide site <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/">FixMyStreet.com</a>
    — so reports made on FixMyStreet.com will also be shown here, and vice
    versa.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>How do I use this site?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    Begin by entering the location of your issue <a href="/">on the front
    page</a>. You can use the name of a street, area, a place or a postcode —
    or you can click “use my location” which will automatically detect where
    you are.
</p>
<p>
    You’ll be taken to a map centred on that location, where you can view
    reports already made in that area. If someone has already reported your
    issue, there’s no need to report it again: click ‘get updates’ at the
    bottom of the report to be kept informed on progress.
</p>
<p>
    If you don’t see the issue you’ve come to report, start a new one by
    clicking on the map to show precisely where the issue is.
</p>
<p>
    You’ll then be asked to fill in a few details.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Do I have to be a [% c.cobrand.council_name %] resident to use this site?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    No — anyone can use this site.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Do I need to make an account to use this site?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    No; if you wish to see previous reports you have made, you can sign in by
    clicking ‘Sign in’ and then either have a link sent to your email, sign in
    with a previously set password, or set a password using the ‘create an
    account’ link.
</p>
<p>
    If you already have an account on fixmystreet.com, you can use the same
    details on this site.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>How are the issues resolved?

<dd>
<p>
    When you make a report on this site, we ask you where the issue is, what
    category it fits within, and perhaps some other information, like questions
    specific to the category, or which particular street light is broken.
</p>

<p>
    These pieces of information will help direct your report to the right
    place to get it fixed. If the issue is our responsibility, it will drop
    into our internal system which will route it to the correct department. If
    it’s more suited to another authority, we will try and send it there
    instead.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>What happens next?

<dd>
<p>
    When there’s a change in your report’s status, and where you have provided
    your email address, you’ll receive an update. This might tell you, for
    example, that:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>our inspectors have gone out to assess the issue</li>
    <li>our contractors have scheduled the issue for repair</li>
    <li>the issue has been resolved</li>
    <li>The issue has been deemed unsuitable for fixing (as happens in some cases)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These updates are also published on the site so that everyone can see what
    progress has been made.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Can I use this site on my smartphone or tablet?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    Yes - use your device’s browser to visit this site or fixmystreet.com. The
    site works well on all sizes of screen, resizing automatically.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Is there an app I can download?</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Yes, see our <a href="/about/web-app">instructions on how to download the
        [% c.cobrand.council_name %] reporting app</a>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Why do you publish reports online?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    There’s no need to make a report if we’re already aware of the issue, so by
    showing which issues have already been reported, we save your time and
    ours.
</p>
<p>
    Having everything visible online also allows everyone to keep up with an
    issue’s status, even if they aren’t the one who reported it.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>What else can I do on this site?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    You can subscribe to a specific area, so you’ll get an email whenever
    someone makes a report in your chosen neighbourhood.
</p>
<p>
    Search for a location, and then click ‘get updates’ at the bottom of the
    list of reports.
</p>
<p>
    If you run a website and you’d like to publish reports automatically from a
    specific area, you can also access an RSS feed from the ‘get updates’
    interface.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>Can I edit or delete a report?</dt>

<dd>
<p>
    You can remove your name from a report if you have included it by accident,
    or changed your mind about it being published. Visit the report page when
    signed in and click on the link marked ‘hide your name?’.
</p>
<p>
    You’ll then have the option to remove your name from one report or every
    report you’ve made.
</p>
<p>
    If you’d like to edit some other part of your report, please get in touch.
