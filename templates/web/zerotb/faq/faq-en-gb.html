<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>What is this website?</dt>
        <dd>This site was created to help people report anti-tuberculosis drug stockouts in Delhi. It was created in response to the ongoing stockouts reported in India last year (see here). The information will be used to encourage the government to address stockouts as they arise.</dd>
        <dt>What is FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is a site to help people report, view, or discuss local problems they’ve found by simply locating them on a map. It launched in early February 2007.</dd>
        <dt>How do I get in touch with FixMyStreet?</dt>
        <dd>Here’s our <a href="[% c.uri_for( '/contact' ) %]">contact page</a>.</dd>
        <dt>What sort of problems should I report with this site?</dt>
        <dd>This site is primarily for reporting barriers to TB treatment clinics such as drug stockouts.</dd> 
        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>You can either enter a location in Delhi or choose a specific clinic name. If you enter a location, you will be presented with a map of that area. You can then search for a TB clinic in that area to report a stockout.</dd>
        <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
        <dd>They are anonymously reported to the District TB Officer by email. They are also shared with local activists and media to generate awareness of the issue and encourage the government to take action. We respect your privacy: your name and email will NOT be given to any of these groups without your written permission.</dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes. FixMyStreet is run
by a registered charity, though, so if you want to make a contribution, <a
href="https://secure.mysociety.org/donate/">please do</a>.</dd>

    <dt>Can I use the site on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>The website will already work on your mobile phone, adapting to
    the size of your screen automatically.

    <h2>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>I work with a TB clinic, where do you send the reports?</dt>
        <dd>You can contact us to find out where reports go at the moment. Also contact us to update the address or addresses we use.</dd>
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>FixMyStreet is not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>

    <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
    <dd>We want to keep the site locally focused, so restrict the ability to
    move radically between areas.</dd>

    <dt>This site is great – why aren&rsquo;t you better publicised?</dt>
    <dd>As a tiny charity we simply don&rsquo;t have a publicity budget, and we
    rely on word of mouth to advertise the site. We have a whole <a
    href="posters/">array of posters, flyers and badges</a> if you&rsquo;d like
    to publicise us on the web or in your local area, and why not write to your
    local paper to let them know about us?</dd> </dl>
    
    <h2><a name="privacy"></a>Privacy Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Who gets to see my name and email address?</dt>
        <dd>
        Due to the sensitive nature of the stockout situation, if you submit a report, we will NOT share your name or email with anyone unless you give us permission. We may, however, send other information from your report (such as the clinic name and any description you write about the stockouts) to the TB officers with the government or activists in order to raise awareness issue. 
        The only people who will be able to see your name and email address will be the FixMyStreet administrators and team members, and they will never use it for anything other than to help administer FixMyStreet. We will never give or sell your email address to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law. Your name, given in the name field, will not be published anywhere unless you specifically give us permission to.
        </dd>
        <dt>Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address?</dt>
        <dd>Never. We will email you if someone leaves an update on a
problem you&rsquo;ve reported, and send you a questionnaire email four weeks
after you submit a problem, asking for a status update; we&rsquo;ll only ever
send you emails in relation to your problem.</dd>
    </dl>
