    <dl>
        <dt>What is SMIDSY?</dt>
        <dd>
        SMIDSY is short for "Sorry mate, I didn't see you", the most frequent
        excuse provided by those involved in an accident.
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I get in touch with SMIDSY?</dt>
        <dd>Here&rsquo;s our <a href="/contact">contact page</a>.</dd>

        <dt>What sort of incidents should I report on SMIDSY?</dt>
        <dd>
        SMIDSY is for reporting two kinds of incidents involving a cyclist:
        near-misses in which an accident could have occurred or actual
        accidents in which a cyclists, motorist or bystander was hurt. 
        </dd>

        <dt>What isn&rsquo;t SMIDSY for?</dt>
        <dd>SMIDSY is not a way of getting in touch with the council for all
        transport issues &ndash; please use SMIDSY only for reporting incidents such as the above. 
        </dd>

        <dt>How do I use the site?</dt>
        <dd>After entering a postcode or location, you are presented with a map
        of that area. You can view problems already reported in that area, or
        report ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location
        of the problem.</dd>

        <dt>What happens next?</dt>
        <dd>They are reported to the relevant authorities by email (TODO: monthly/quarterly/etc.?)
        TODO
        </dd>
        <dt>Is it free?</dt>
        <dd>The site is free to use, yes. SMIDSY is based on the FixMyStreet
        tool, run by a registered charity, though, so if you want to make a
        contribution, 
        <a href="https://secure.mysociety.org/donate/">please do</a>.</dd>

        <dt>Can I use SMIDSY on my mobile?</dt>
        <dd>
        <p>The SMIDSY website will already work on your mobile phone, adapting to
        the size of your screen automatically.
        Looking for a mobile app? We don't have one yet, but with your support
        we can build one. <a href="mailto:supportsmidsy@mysociety.org">Support Us</a>.

    <h2><a name="practical"></a>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, where do you send the reports?</dt>
        <dd>You can either leave a test report or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to find out where reports go at the moment. Also <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to update the address or addresses we use.</dd>
        <dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, can we have SMIDSY on our website?</dt>
        <dd>Yes you can! We offer branded, hosted versions of SMIDSY for local council websites, as we do for FixMyStreet. <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/for-councils/fixmystreet/">Full details</a>.</dd>
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>SMIDSY and FixMyStreet are not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>

        <dt>Why does the site use kilometres for measurements?</dt>
        <dd>Thanks for asking politely &ndash; we never quite understand why some of the rudest
        emails we receive are on this topic. The British national
        grid reference system, devised by Ordnance Survey (the British national
        mapping agency) around the time of the second world war, uses eastings and
        northings measured in metres and kilometres; the maps we use are from
        Ordnance Survey and so this is what we use to display distances.
        There you have it: not everything British is in miles!</dd>

        <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
        <dd>

        # TODO, actually we might want to be able to zoom out for SMIDSY?
        
        We want to keep FixMyStreet locally focused, so restrict the ability to
        move radically between areas. The map on Your Reports will let you see all
        the reports you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are. If you&rsquo;re from the
        council then the emailed version of the problem report also contains the
        closest road and postcode to the pin on the map.</dd>

        <dt>This site is great – why aren&rsquo;t you better publicised?</dt>
        <dd>As a tiny charity we simply don&rsquo;t have a publicity budget, and we
        rely on word of mouth to advertise the site. We have a whole <a
        href="posters/">array of posters, flyers and badges</a> if you&rsquo;d like
        to publicise us on the web or in your local area, and why not write to your
        local paper to let them know about us?</dd>
