    <h2><a name="practical"></a>Practical Questions</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, where do you send the incidents?</dt>
        <dd>You can either leave a test incident or <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to find out where incidents go at the moment. Also <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
to update the address or addresses we use.</dd>
        <dt>I&rsquo;m from a council, can we have Collideoscope on our website?</dt>
        <dd>Yes you can! We offer branded, hosted versions of Collideoscope for local council websites, as we do for FixMyStreet. <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> for more details.</dd>
        <dt>Do you remove silly or illegal content?</dt>
        <dd>Collideoscope are not responsible for the content and accuracy
of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any
problems or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed
by a user of the site.</dd>

        <dt>Why does the site use kilometres for measurements?</dt>
        <dd>The British national grid reference system, devised by Ordnance Survey (the British national
        mapping agency) around the time of the second world war, uses eastings and
        northings measured in metres and kilometres; the maps we use are from
        Ordnance Survey and so this is what we use to display distances.
        There you have it: not everything British is in miles!</dd>

        <dt>Why can&rsquo;t I zoom out more on the reporting map?</dt>
        <dd>        
        We want to keep Collideoscope locally focused, so restrict the ability to
        move radically between areas. The map on Your incidents will let you see all
        the incidents you&rsquo;ve made, wherever they are. If you&rsquo;re from the
        council then the emailed version of the problem incident also contains the
        closest road and postcode to the pin on the map.</dd>

        <dt>This site is great â€“ why aren&rsquo;t you better publicised?</dt>
        <dd>We're focussing on making Collideoscope as good as it can be for the moment, for the benefit of our users and our sponsors. As a result we rely on word of mouth to advertise the site.</dd>

        <dt>Who built Collideoscope?</dt>
        <dd>Collideoscope was built by <a href="http://www.mysociety.org/">mySociety</a> and <a href="http://itpworld.net">Integrated Transport Planning Ltd</a>. It is based upon the FixMyStreet project, <a href="http://www.fixmystreet.com/faq#organisation">See full credits for FixMyStreet</a>.

        <dt>Why build Collideoscope?</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>This website is our attempt to enable society to collaborate in order to collect some much-needed evidence to inform the ongoing cycle-safety debate. Our aim is to build a map of cycling-related incidents and near-misses for the UK so that transport planners, health researchers and decision-makers can see for the first time where incidents are happening, how often they take place, and how serious they are. We believe this kind of evidence fills a gap that will potentially enable local Councils to make proactive changes to highway environments so as to prevent serious, and potentially fatal, cycling incidents from occurring in the future.</p>
