<h1>Cheshire East FixMyStreet</h1>

<p>We are working with FixMyStreet to help people report or see reports of  local issues, by simply locating them on a map.</p>

<p>You can use Cheshire East’s FixMyStreet to report Highways issues like potholes or broken street lights, request Street Cleansing work such as fly-tipping removal or street sweeping, and ask our Community Enforcement team to investigate abandoned vehicles.</p>


    <p>See our webpages to report problems <strong>such as</strong>:</p>

    <h2>How to use our FixMyStreet pages</h2>

    <h3>Making a report</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>If the matter poses an immediate risk to health, life, or property, please call 0300 123 5025 to report it directly to one of our staff</strong>
        <li>Start at the <a href="/">homepage</a> and type in your postcode or a place name. Not sure where you are? Pick ‘use my location’
        <li>Put the pin in the map to show exactly where the problem is, choose an option for what to report from the menu, and then continue
        <li>Follow any instructions and answer any following questions shown to you, then submit your report
        <li>Check your email inbox for our confirmation mail, click on the link, and job done
    </ol>

    <p>You can use the website on your mobile directly, or see our <a
        href="/about/web-app">instructions on how to download the
        [% c.cobrand.council_name %] reporting app</a>.</p>

<h3>Looking at other people’s reports</h3>

<p>You can see anonymised reports made by other people on our map as pins.
    You can click on these to see what they are about, and any updates that we
    have provided. If you have a FixMyStreet account you can also subscribe to
    updates for another person’s report, rather than create your own.
</p>

<h3>Problems zoom out on the reporting map?</h3>

<p>We want to keep FixMyStreet locally focused, so we restrict how far you can zoom out. You can use your device location to centre the map on where you are.</p>

<h3>Inappropriate content</h3>

<p>Cheshire East Council and FixMyStreet are not responsible for the content and accuracy of material submitted by its users. We reserve the right to edit or remove any reports or updates which we consider to be inappropriate upon being informed by a user of the site.
