    FixMyStreet helps you send a report to your council, but we're not responsible for fixing things.
    If you'd like to chase your issue, please search your inbox for the latest reply, or auto-reply
    from your council, and respond to that.

    Meanwhile, if you're getting nowhere, you might consider writing to your local councillor or other
    representative to see if they can help.
