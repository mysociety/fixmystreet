    <dt>How can I report a pothole, street or road problem?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            This easy to use web site is designed to help Northamptonshire residents to report,
            view, or discuss local highway faults, including potholes, directly and quickly
            to us by simply locating them on a map. You can do this by using your computer
            or your mobile phone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please report one problem at a time; you will be given an opportunity at the end
            to report another problem using the personal details previously entered.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are reporting an emergency please do not report it online, but ring our
            Customer Service Centre on
            <strong><a href="tel:03001267000">0300&nbsp;126&nbsp;7000</a></strong> for West Northamptonshire Council and
            <strong><a href="tel:03001263000">0300&nbsp;126&nbsp;3000</a></strong> for North Northamptonshire Council.

    <dt>What sort of problems can I report?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            You can report faults linked to amenities or problems that are broken or dirty,
            damaged or dumped, or need fixing, cleaning or clearing such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drain Covers</li>
            <li>Kerbs</li>
            <li>Safety Bollards</li>
            <li>Potholes</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>What isn&rsquo;t it for?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            The web site is not a way of getting in touch with the council for all issues
            — please use it only for problems highlighted above.
        </p>
        <p>
            As we often route problems via our cleansing services or highways departments,
            using the site for other matters may result in a delay in your report getting
            to the right people.

    <dt>How do I use the reporting tool on the site?</dt>
    <dd>
        After entering a postcode or location, you will then be presented with a map of
        that area. You can then view problems already reported in that area, or report new
        ones of your own simply by clicking on the map at the location of the problem.
    </dd>

    <dt>How are the problems solved?</dt>
    <dd>
        They are reported to us automatically. We then resolve the problem the way we
        normally would and update the fault on the map.
    </dd>

    <dt>What does the map show?</dt>
    <dd>
        The map shows all faults submitted online. You can view the exact location of
        each fault and see its current status.
    </dd>

    <dt>What updates will I receive?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            When you record a fault you can sign up to receive updates and you will
            receive an initial email to acknowledge the report.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will then receive an email every time that fault is updated. This could be when
            a member of the public posts an update onto the fault or when we post a status update.
        </p>
        <p>
            Road problems that are the responsibility of our Highways department, such as potholes,
            will receive automatic updates at different stages. You will receive an email when the
            problem has been inspected and another one when a decision has been made on the action
            required.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some faults may be marked as referred when they are not the responsibility of Northamptonshire
            Highways, for example problems such as graffiti or rubbish which are the responsibility
            of the District Council for that area.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these updates will also be posted on the mapped fault so that anyone can see the status of any
            fault recorded by clicking on it on the map.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I get an update on a fault?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            When you record a fault you can sign up to receive updates. You will then receive an initial
            email to acknowledge the report. In time, you will receive a further email when the problem is
            assigned for inspection, one if the problem needs to be referred to another department or
            organisation, and a final email when it is fixed or requires no further work.
        </p>
        <p>
            These updates will also be posted on the mapped fault so that anyone can see the status of
            any fault recorded by clicking on it on the map.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I report a fault on my mobile?</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>
            Yes, you can view our website on your phone or tablet and it will automatically adapt to the
            size of your screen.
        </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Is there an app I can download?</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>
        Yes, see our <a href="/about/web-app">instructions on how to download
            the [% c.cobrand.council_name %] reporting app</a>.

    <dd>
        The maps are from Ordnance Survey who based their grid reference
        system on measurements in metres and kilometres.
    </dd>

    <dt>How do I report a fault outside of Northamptonshire?</dt>
    <dd>
        The map only shows locations within Northamptonshire to keep it locally focussed.
