<p>Shropshire council provides a website and app to make it easier for residents to report, view and update issues or concerns on the highway or with assets that are maintained by the council.</p>

<p>When you make a report to the council using the new website or app, you can choose to make your personal details public or hidden so your details will not appear on the report.</p>

<p>If you make a report another way, including via the council's website, email address, social media, phone or email, the council will log the report on our online website and app to allow you and the wider public to view or comment on the report.</p>

<p>The council will publish details of the issue or concern with a place or asset, for example if you are reporting a pothole, streetlight defect, fly tip or one of over a hundred service categories available on the council fault reporting website or app. In some cases, the council may choose not to make a report viewable by the wider public if the report is of a sensitive nature or may identify an individual. The council will never include your personal information when you make a report.</p>

    with which this site is linked. Henceforth this privacy policy will refer

</p>

<p>
    Reports made on this site also appear on fixmystreet.com, and vice versa.

    [% c.cobrand.council_name %] administrators.

<h2>What information we collect and how we use it</h2>

<h3>
When you make a report
</h3>

<p>
    You may have provided us with personal information including:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Contact details</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This information, together with details of the issue, are routed directly
    to the contact or contacts responsible for fixing it, based on two pieces
    of data: the issue category, and its location.
</p>

<p>
    If the issue is the responsibility of [% c.cobrand.council_name %], your
    report comes into our system. But this site also has the ability to route
    your report to a different authority if they are the ones responsbile for
    it. This might be a different council, or a body such as TfL or Highways
    England.
</p>

<p>
    If the report falls within our boundaries, <b>your report appears publicly
    on both this site and on fixmystreet.com</b>, in some cases even if it has
    been sent to another authority. It may additionally appear on that other
    authority’s website, if they also use FixMyStreet as their reporting
    software.
</p>

<p>
    Information that you enter in the email address and phone number fields
    <strong>are not published</strong>, and your name is <strong>only published
    if you have checked the box opting to do so</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    FixMyStreet provides RSS/JSON feeds, accessible from both fixmystreet.com
    and this site, which allow anyone to publish reports on their own website
    or page. Typically these feeds consist of reports made within a specific
    local area, and are published on community or local interest sites.
</p>

<p>
  [% IF c.cobrand.moniker == 'cheshireeast' %]

    Research
</h2>

<p>
    mySociety sometimes use report data, or share it with trusted third

    the content of reports. mySociety’s Research Data Release policy may be

        address, in most cases <b>our reply will go directly to your email inbox</b>.

  [% IF c.cobrand.send_questionnaires %]

<h3>
    Subscribing to alerts
</h3>

<p>
    If you subscribe to an alert, you’ll receive an automated email every time
    someone makes a report within the area you specify. The frequency of these
    emails will depend on how large your chosen area is and how many reports
    are made within it, but you won’t get more than one an hour.

    If you’ve opted to follow a report, you’ll receive an email each time an
    update is made, which could be a change in status made by our team, a
    comment made by another member of the public, or an update from the person
    who made the report originally.
</p>

<h2>
    Unsubscribing

<h2>
    Legal basis for processing

<p>
    In using FixMyStreet for any of the functions listed above (sending a

    processed by both [% c.cobrand.council_name %] and mySociety.
</p>
<p>
    [% c.cobrand.council_name %] is the data controller and mySociety is a data

[% IF c.cobrand.moniker == 'shropshire' %]
<p>Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR 2016 – the processing is necessary for the

    mySociety also runs a service called FixMyStreet. If you report a problem
    that [% c.cobrand.council_name %] is responsible for directly on
    FixMyStreet, rather than this site, mySociety will share your report (and
    personal details if provided) with us.
</p>

<p>
    This sharing is in accordance with the FixMyStreet
    <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/faq">terms of service</a> and their
    <a href="https://www.fixmystreet.com/about/privacy">privacy statement</a>.

<h2>
    Retention periods and your right to removal
</h2>

<h3>
    Reports and updates
</h3>

<p>
    Except in exceptional circumstances, reports or updates made through this site
    or FixMyStreet are not deleted. Historic reports provide an invaluable resource for
    researchers into the quantity and type of street problems made across the UK during
    the years the site has been running. This research can help inform civic planners,
    developers, coders, historians and social scientists, among others.
</p>

<p>
    Therefore, <b>if you ask for a report to be removed, in most cases you will instead be
    invited to anonymise it</b>, so that there is no public connection between the content and
    your name. You can anonymise reports singly, or in bulk, by logging in to your account
    on either this site or on fixmystreet.com and clicking on the ‘“Hide your
    name” link beside the time and date of your report. From here you may
    anonymise this report or all reports you have made.
</p>

<p>
    If you do not already have an account, it is simple to register, and once
    you have done so you will have access to all the reports you have made
    under that email address.
</p>

<p>
    Changes you make to your reports will apply immediately on
    [% IF c.cobrand.moniker == 'shropshire' %]
    https://improvingyourroads.shropshire.gov.uk/,
    [% ELSE %]
    this site,
    [% END %]
    on
    fixmystreet.com and will also be reflected, sometimes with a delay,
    anywhere else they appear (see “What information we collect and how we use
    it”, above, for more details about where reports are published). If you do
    not see the changes, please ‘hard refresh’ your browser by eg pressing the
    Ctrl and F5 keys simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
    Search engines such as Google often take a little time to reflect changes
    to content, but anonymising your report should also remove your name from
    their search results once the pages have been recrawled by their robots.
</p>

<h3>
    Your personal information
</h3>

<p>
    As well as your report or update appearing on this site and the FixMyStreet
    website, your details, including name and email address, are stored in
    FixMyStreet’s admin system.
</p>

<p>
    If you submit a report but do not click on the confirmation email, your
    report will not be sent or published; however, the report and your details
    remain in our system and are accessible to site administrators.
</p>

<p>
    Personal details will automatically be removed from the database after two
    years of inactivity of the associated account.
