  =head1 NAME
  
  App::cpanminus - get, unpack, build and install modules from CPAN
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      cpanm Module
  
  Run C<cpanm -h> or C<perldoc cpanm> for more options.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  cpanminus is a script to get, unpack, build and install modules from
  CPAN and does nothing else.
  
  It's dependency free (can bootstrap itself), requires zero
  configuration, and stands alone. When running, it requires only 10MB
  of RAM.
  
  =head1 INSTALLATION
  
  There are several ways to install cpanminus to your system.
  
  =head2 Package management system
  
  There are Debian packages, RPMs, FreeBSD ports, and packages for other
  operation systems available. If you want to use the package management system,
  search for cpanminus and use the appropriate command to install. This makes it
  easy to install C<cpanm> to your system without thinking about where to
  install, and later upgrade.
  
  =head2 Installing to system perl
  
  You can also use the latest cpanminus to install cpanminus itself:
  
      curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus
  
  This will install C<cpanm> to your bin directory like
  C</usr/local/bin> and you'll need the C<--sudo> option to write to
  the directory, unless you configured C<INSTALL_BASE> with L<local::lib>.
  
  =head2 Installing to local perl (perlbrew, plenv etc.)
  
  If you have perl in your home directory, which is the case if you use
  tools like L<perlbrew> or plenv, you don't need the C<--sudo> option, since
  you're most likely to have a write permission to the perl's library
  path. You can just do:
  
      curl -L https://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
  
  to install the C<cpanm> executable to the perl's bin path, like
  C<~/perl5/perlbrew/bin/cpanm>.
  
  =head2 Downloading the standalone executable
  
  You can also copy the standalone executable to whatever location you'd like.
  
      cd ~/bin
      curl -L https://cpanmin.us/ -o cpanm
      chmod +x cpanm
  
  This just works, but be sure to grab the new version manually when you
  upgrade because C<--self-upgrade> might not work with this installation setup.
  
  =head2 Troubleshoot: HTTPS warnings
  
  When you run C<curl> commands above, you may encounter SSL handshake
  errors or certification warnings. This is due to your HTTP client
  (curl) being old, or SSL certificates installed on your system needs
  to be updated.
  
  You're recommended to update the software or system if you can. If
  that is impossible or difficult, use the C<-k> option with curl or an
  alternative URL, C<https://git.io/cpanm>

  =head1 QUESTIONS
  
  =head2 How does cpanm get/parse/update the CPAN index?
  
  It queries the CPAN Meta DB site at L<http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/>.
  The site is updated at least every hour to reflect the latest changes
  from fast syncing mirrors. The script then also falls back to query the
  module at L<http://metacpan.org/> using its seach API.
  
  Upon calling these API hosts, cpanm (1.6004 or later) will send the
  local perl versions to the server in User-Agent string by default. You
  can turn it off with C<--no-report-perl-version> option. Read more
  about the option with L<cpanm>, and read more about the privacy policy
  about this data collection at L<http://cpanmetadb.plackperl.org/#privacy>
  
  Fetched files are unpacked in C<~/.cpanm> and automatically cleaned up
  periodically.  You can configure the location of this with the
  C<PERL_CPANM_HOME> environment variable.
  
  =head2 Where does this install modules to? Do I need root access?
  
  It installs to wherever ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build are
  configured to (via C<PERL_MM_OPT> and C<PERL_MB_OPT>).
  
  By default, it installs to the site_perl directory that belongs to
  your perl. You can see the locations for that by running C<perl -V>
  and it will be likely something under C</opt/local/perl/...> if you're
  using system perl, or under your home directory if you have built perl
  yourself using perlbrew or plenv.
  
  If you've already configured local::lib on your shell, cpanm respects
  that settings and modules will be installed to your local perl5
  directory.
  
  At a boot time, cpanminus checks whether you have already configured
  local::lib, or have a permission to install modules to the site_perl
  directory.  If neither, i.e. you're using system perl and do not run
  cpanm as a root, it automatically sets up local::lib compatible
  installation path in a C<perl5> directory under your home
  directory.
  
  To avoid this, run C<cpanm> either as a root user, with C<--sudo>
  option, or with C<--local-lib> option.
  
  =head2 cpanminus can't install the module XYZ. Is it a bug?
  
  It is more likely a problem with the distribution itself. cpanminus
  doesn't support or may have issues with distributions such as follows:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  Tests that require input from STDIN.
  
  =item *
  
  Build.PL or Makefile.PL that prompts for input even when
  C<PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT> is enabled.
  
  =item *
  
  Modules that have invalid numeric values as VERSION (such as C<1.1a>)
  
  =back
  
  These failures can be reported back to the author of the module so
  that they can fix it accordingly, rather than to cpanminus.
  
  =head2 Does cpanm support the feature XYZ of L<CPAN> and L<CPANPLUS>?
  
  Most likely not. Here are the things that cpanm doesn't do by
  itself.
  
  If you need these features, use L<CPAN>, L<CPANPLUS> or the standalone
  tools that are mentioned.

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    Many online services that are centered around CPAN attempt to
    associate multiple uploads by extracting a distribution name from
    the filename of the upload. For most distributions this is easy as
    they have used ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build to create the
    distribution, which results in a uniform name. But sadly not all
    uploads are created in this way.
    
    C<CPAN::DistnameInfo> uses heuristics that have been learnt by
    L<http://search.cpan.org/> to extract the distribution name and
    version from filenames and also report if the version is to be
    treated as a developer release
    
    The constructor takes a single pathname, returning an object with the following methods
    
    =over
    
    =item cpanid
    
    If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this will be the
    the CPAN id of the author.
    
    =item dist
    
    The name of the distribution
    
    =item distvname
    
    The file name with any suffix and leading directory names removed
    
    =item filename
    
    If the path given looked like a CPAN authors directory path, then this will be the
    path to the file relative to the detected CPAN author directory. Otherwise it is the path
    that was passed in.
    
    =item maturity
    
    The maturity of the distribution. This will be either C<released> or C<developer>
    
    =item extension
    
    The extension of the distribution, often used to denote the archive type (e.g. 'tar.gz')
    
    =item pathname
    
    The pathname that was passed to the constructor when creating the object.
    
    =item properties
    
    This will return a list of key-value pairs, suitable for assigning to a hash,
    for the known properties.
    
    =item version
    
    The extracted version

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    Software distributions released to the CPAN include a F<META.json> or, for
    older distributions, F<META.yml>, which describes the distribution, its
    contents, and the requirements for building and installing the distribution.
    The data structure stored in the F<META.json> file is described in
    L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.
    
    CPAN::Meta provides a simple class to represent this distribution metadata (or
    I<distmeta>), along with some helpful methods for interrogating that data.
    
    The documentation below is only for the methods of the CPAN::Meta object.  For
    information on the meaning of individual fields, consult the spec.
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =head2 new
    
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->new($distmeta_struct, \%options);
    
    Returns a valid CPAN::Meta object or dies if the supplied metadata hash
    reference fails to validate.  Older-format metadata will be up-converted to
    version 2 if they validate against the original stated specification.
    
    It takes an optional hashref of options. Valid options include:
    
    =over
    
    =item *
    
    lazy_validation -- if true, new will attempt to convert the given metadata
    to version 2 before attempting to validate it.  This means than any
    fixable errors will be handled by CPAN::Meta::Converter before validation.
    (Note that this might result in invalid optional data being silently
    dropped.)  The default is false.
    
    =back
    
    =head2 create
    
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->create($distmeta_struct, \%options);
    
    This is same as C<new()>, except that C<generated_by> and C<meta-spec> fields
    will be generated if not provided.  This means the metadata structure is
    assumed to otherwise follow the latest L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.
    
    =head2 load_file
    
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file($distmeta_file, \%options);
    
    Given a pathname to a file containing metadata, this deserializes the file
    according to its file suffix and constructs a new C<CPAN::Meta> object, just
    like C<new()>.  It will die if the deserialized version fails to validate
    against its stated specification version.
    
    It takes the same options as C<new()> but C<lazy_validation> defaults to
    true.
    
    =head2 load_yaml_string
    
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_yaml_string($yaml, \%options);
    
    This method returns a new CPAN::Meta object using the first document in the
    given YAML string.  In other respects it is identical to C<load_file()>.
    
    =head2 load_json_string
    
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_json_string($json, \%options);
    
    This method returns a new CPAN::Meta object using the structure represented by
    the given JSON string.  In other respects it is identical to C<load_file()>.
    
    =head2 load_string
    
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_string($string, \%options);
    
    If you don't know if a string contains YAML or JSON, this method will use
    L<Parse::CPAN::Meta> to guess.  In other respects it is identical to
    C<load_file()>.
    
    =head2 save
    
      $meta->save($distmeta_file, \%options);
    
    Serializes the object as JSON and writes it to the given file.  The only valid
    option is C<version>, which defaults to '2'. On Perl 5.8.1 or later, the file
    is saved with UTF-8 encoding.
    
    For C<version> 2 (or higher), the filename should end in '.json'.  L<JSON::PP>
    is the default JSON backend. Using another JSON backend requires L<JSON> 2.5 or
    later and you must set the C<$ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND}> to a supported alternate
    backend like L<JSON::XS>.
    
    For C<version> less than 2, the filename should end in '.yml'.
    L<CPAN::Meta::Converter> is used to generate an older metadata structure, which
    is serialized to YAML.  CPAN::Meta::YAML is the default YAML backend.  You may
    set the C<$ENV{PERL_YAML_BACKEND}> to a supported alternative backend, though
    this is not recommended due to subtle incompatibilities between YAML parsers on
    CPAN.
    
    =head2 meta_spec_version
    
    This method returns the version part of the C<meta_spec> entry in the distmeta
    structure.  It is equivalent to:
    
      $meta->meta_spec->{version};
    
    =head2 effective_prereqs
    
      my $prereqs = $meta->effective_prereqs;
    
      my $prereqs = $meta->effective_prereqs( \@feature_identifiers );
    
    This method returns a L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object describing all the
    prereqs for the distribution.  If an arrayref of feature identifiers is given,
    the prereqs for the identified features are merged together with the
    distribution's core prereqs before the CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object is returned.
    
    =head2 should_index_file
    
      ... if $meta->should_index_file( $filename );
    
    This method returns true if the given file should be indexed.  It decides this
    by checking the C<file> and C<directory> keys in the C<no_index> property of
    the distmeta structure. Note that neither the version format nor
    C<release_status> are considered.
    
    C<$filename> should be given in unix format.
    
    =head2 should_index_package
    
      ... if $meta->should_index_package( $package );
    
    This method returns true if the given package should be indexed.  It decides
    this by checking the C<package> and C<namespace> keys in the C<no_index>
    property of the distmeta structure. Note that neither the version format nor
    C<release_status> are considered.
    
    =head2 features
    
      my @feature_objects = $meta->features;
    
    This method returns a list of L<CPAN::Meta::Feature> objects, one for each
    optional feature described by the distribution's metadata.
    
    =head2 feature
    
      my $feature_object = $meta->feature( $identifier );
    
    This method returns a L<CPAN::Meta::Feature> object for the optional feature
    with the given identifier.  If no feature with that identifier exists, an
    exception will be raised.
    
    =head2 as_struct
    
      my $copy = $meta->as_struct( \%options );
    
    This method returns a deep copy of the object's metadata as an unblessed hash
    reference.  It takes an optional hashref of options.  If the hashref contains
    a C<version> argument, the copied metadata will be converted to the version
    of the specification and returned.  For example:
    
      my $old_spec = $meta->as_struct( {version => "1.4"} );
    
    =head2 as_string
    
      my $string = $meta->as_string( \%options );
    
    This method returns a serialized copy of the object's metadata as a character
    string.  (The strings are B<not> UTF-8 encoded.)  It takes an optional hashref
    of options.  If the hashref contains a C<version> argument, the copied metadata
    will be converted to the version of the specification and returned.  For
    example:
    
      my $string = $meta->as_string( {version => "1.4"} );
    
    For C<version> greater than or equal to 2, the string will be serialized as
    JSON.  For C<version> less than 2, the string will be serialized as YAML.  In
    both cases, the same rules are followed as in the C<save()> method for choosing
    a serialization backend.
    
    The serialized structure will include a C<x_serialization_backend> entry giving
    the package and version used to serialize.  Any existing key in the given
    C<$meta> object will be clobbered.
    
    =head1 STRING DATA
    
    The following methods return a single value, which is the value for the
    corresponding entry in the distmeta structure.  Values should be either undef
    or strings.

     warn "$_\n" for verify_dependencies($meta, [qw/runtime build test/], 'requires');
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This module verifies if requirements described in a CPAN::Meta object are present.
    
    =head1 FUNCTIONS
    
    =head2 check_requirements($reqs, $type, $incdirs)
    
    This function checks if all dependencies in C<$reqs> (a L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements|CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object) are met, taking into account that 'conflicts' dependencies have to be checked in reverse. It returns a hash with the modules as keys and any problems as values; the value for a successfully found module will be undef. Modules are searched for in C<@$incdirs>, defaulting to C<@INC>.
    
    =head2 verify_dependencies($meta, $phases, $types, $incdirs)
    
    Check all requirements in C<$meta> for phases C<$phases> and type C<$type>. Modules are searched for in C<@$incdirs>, defaulting to C<@INC>. C<$meta> should be a L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> or L<CPAN::Meta> object.
    
    =head2 requirements_for($meta, $phases, $types)
    
    B<< This function is deprecated and may be removed at some point in the future, please use CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->merged_requirements instead. >>
    
    This function returns a unified L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements|CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object for all C<$type> requirements for C<$phases>. C<$phases> may be either one (scalar) value or an arrayref of valid values as defined by the L<CPAN::Meta spec|CPAN::Meta::Spec>. C<$type> must be a relationship as defined by the same spec. C<$meta> should be a L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> or L<CPAN::Meta> object.

    #pod
    #pod Conversion proceeds through each version in turn.  For example, a version 1.2
    #pod structure might be converted to 1.3 then 1.4 then finally to version 2. The
    #pod conversion process attempts to clean-up simple errors and standardize data.
    #pod For example, if C<author> is given as a scalar, it will converted to an array
    #pod reference containing the item. (Converting a structure to its own version will
    #pod also clean-up and standardize.)
    #pod
    #pod When data are cleaned and standardized, missing or invalid fields will be
    #pod replaced with sensible defaults when possible.  This may be lossy or imprecise.
    #pod For example, some badly structured META.yml files on CPAN have prerequisite
    #pod modules listed as both keys and values:
    #pod
    #pod   requires => { 'Foo::Bar' => 'Bam::Baz' }
    #pod
    #pod These would be split and each converted to a prerequisite with a minimum
    #pod version of zero.
    #pod
    #pod When some mandatory fields are missing or invalid, the conversion will attempt
    #pod to provide a sensible default or will fill them with a value of 'unknown'.  For
    #pod example a missing or unrecognized C<license> field will result in a C<license>
    #pod field of 'unknown'.  Fields that may get an 'unknown' include:

    =head1 NAME
    
    CPAN::Meta::Converter - Convert CPAN distribution metadata structures
    
    =head1 VERSION
    
    version 2.150005
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
      my $struct = decode_json_file('META.json');
    
      my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct );
    
      my $new_struct = $cmc->convert( version => "2" );
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This module converts CPAN Meta structures from one form to another.  The
    primary use is to convert older structures to the most modern version of
    the specification, but other transformations may be implemented in the
    future as needed.  (E.g. stripping all custom fields or stripping all
    optional fields.)
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =head2 new
    
      my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct );
    
    The constructor should be passed a valid metadata structure but invalid
    structures are accepted.  If no meta-spec version is provided, version 1.0 will
    be assumed.
    
    Optionally, you can provide a C<default_version> argument after C<$struct>:
    
      my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct, default_version => "1.4" );
    
    This is only needed when converting a metadata fragment that does not include a
    C<meta-spec> field.
    
    =head2 convert
    
      my $new_struct = $cmc->convert( version => "2" );
    
    Returns a new hash reference with the metadata converted to a different form.
    C<convert> will die if any conversion/standardization still results in an
    invalid structure.
    
    Valid parameters include:

    C<version> -- Indicates the desired specification version (e.g. "1.0", "1.1" ... "1.4", "2").
    Defaults to the latest version of the CPAN Meta Spec.
    
    =back
    
    Conversion proceeds through each version in turn.  For example, a version 1.2
    structure might be converted to 1.3 then 1.4 then finally to version 2. The
    conversion process attempts to clean-up simple errors and standardize data.
    For example, if C<author> is given as a scalar, it will converted to an array
    reference containing the item. (Converting a structure to its own version will
    also clean-up and standardize.)
    
    When data are cleaned and standardized, missing or invalid fields will be
    replaced with sensible defaults when possible.  This may be lossy or imprecise.
    For example, some badly structured META.yml files on CPAN have prerequisite
    modules listed as both keys and values:
    
      requires => { 'Foo::Bar' => 'Bam::Baz' }
    
    These would be split and each converted to a prerequisite with a minimum
    version of zero.
    
    When some mandatory fields are missing or invalid, the conversion will attempt
    to provide a sensible default or will fill them with a value of 'unknown'.  For
    example a missing or unrecognized C<license> field will result in a C<license>
    field of 'unknown'.  Fields that may get an 'unknown' include:

    =head1 NAME
    
    CPAN::Meta::History - history of CPAN Meta Spec changes
    
    =head1 VERSION
    
    version 2.150005
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    The CPAN Meta Spec has gone through several iterations.  It was
    originally written in HTML and later revised into POD (though published
    in HTML generated from the POD).  Fields were added, removed or changed,
    sometimes by design and sometimes to reflect real-world usage after the
    fact.
    
    This document reconstructs the history of the CPAN Meta Spec based on
    change logs, repository commit messages and the published HTML files.
    In some cases, particularly prior to version 1.2, the exact version
    when certain fields were introduced or changed is inconsistent between
    sources.  When in doubt, the published HTML files for versions 1.0 to
    1.4 as they existed when version 2 was developed are used as the
    definitive source.
    
    Starting with version 2, the specification document is part of the
    CPAN-Meta distribution and will be published on CPAN as
    L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.
    
    Going forward, specification version numbers will be integers and
    decimal portions will correspond to a release date for the CPAN::Meta
    library.
    
    =head1 HISTORY

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =head2 new
    
    This creates a CPAN::Meta::Merge object. It takes one mandatory named
    argument, C<version>, declaring the version of the meta-spec that must be
    used for the merge. It can optionally take an C<extra_mappings> argument
    that allows one to add additional merging functions for specific elements.
    
    =head2 merge(@fragments)
    
    Merge all C<@fragments> together. It will accept both CPAN::Meta objects and
    (possibly incomplete) hashrefs of metadata.

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    A CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object represents the prerequisites for a CPAN
    distribution or one of its optional features.  Each set of prereqs is

    =head2 new
    
      my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new( \%prereq_spec );
    
    This method returns a new set of Prereqs.  The input should look like the
    contents of the C<prereqs> field described in L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>, meaning
    something more or less like this:
    
      my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new({
        runtime => {
          requires => {
            'Some::Module' => '1.234',

          },
          ...,
        },
        ...,
      });
    
    You can also construct an empty set of prereqs with:
    
      my $prereqs = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new;
    
    This empty set of prereqs is useful for accumulating new prereqs before finally
    dumping the whole set into a structure or string.
    
    =head2 requirements_for
    
      my $requirements = $prereqs->requirements_for( $phase, $type );
    
    This method returns a L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object for the given
    phase/type combination.  If no prerequisites are registered for that
    combination, a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object will be returned, and it may
    be added to as needed.
    
    If C<$phase> or C<$type> are undefined or otherwise invalid, an exception will
    be raised.
    
    =head2 with_merged_prereqs
    
      my $new_prereqs = $prereqs->with_merged_prereqs( $other_prereqs );
    
      my $new_prereqs = $prereqs->with_merged_prereqs( \@other_prereqs );
    
    This method returns a new CPAN::Meta::Prereqs objects in which all the
    other prerequisites given are merged into the current set.  This is primarily
    provided for combining a distribution's core prereqs with the prereqs of one of
    its optional features.
    
    The new prereqs object has no ties to the originals, and altering it further
    will not alter them.
    
    =head2 merged_requirements
    
        my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements( \@phases, \@types );
        my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements( \@phases );
        my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements();
    
    This method joins together all requirements across a number of phases
    and types into a new L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object.  If arguments
    are omitted, it defaults to "runtime", "build" and "test" for phases
    and "requires" and "recommends" for types.
    
    =head2 as_string_hash
    
    This method returns a hashref containing structures suitable for dumping into a
    distmeta data structure.  It is made up of hashes and strings, only; there will
    be no Prereqs, CPAN::Meta::Requirements, or C<version> objects inside it.
    
    =head2 is_finalized
    
    This method returns true if the set of prereqs has been marked "finalized," and
    cannot be altered.
    
    =head2 finalize
    
    Calling C<finalize> on a Prereqs object will close it for further modification.
    Attempting to make any changes that would actually alter the prereqs will
    result in an exception being thrown.
    
    =head2 clone
    
      my $cloned_prereqs = $prereqs->clone;
    
    This method returns a Prereqs object that is identical to the original object,
    but can be altered without affecting the original object.  Finalization does
    not survive cloning, meaning that you may clone a finalized set of prereqs and
    then modify the clone.

    #pod A CPAN::Meta::Requirements object models a set of version constraints like
    #pod those specified in the F<META.yml> or F<META.json> files in CPAN distributions,
    #pod and as defined by L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>;
    #pod It can be built up by adding more and more constraints, and it will reduce them
    #pod to the simplest representation.
    #pod
    #pod Logically impossible constraints will be identified immediately by thrown
    #pod exceptions.

    =head1 NAME
    
    CPAN::Meta::Requirements - a set of version requirements for a CPAN dist
    
    =head1 VERSION
    
    version 2.133
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
      use CPAN::Meta::Requirements;
    
      my $build_requires = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->new;
    
      $build_requires->add_minimum('Library::Foo' => 1.208);
    
      $build_requires->add_minimum('Library::Foo' => 2.602);
    
      $build_requires->add_minimum('Module::Bar'  => 'v1.2.3');
    
      $METAyml->{build_requires} = $build_requires->as_string_hash;
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    A CPAN::Meta::Requirements object models a set of version constraints like
    those specified in the F<META.yml> or F<META.json> files in CPAN distributions,
    and as defined by L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>;
    It can be built up by adding more and more constraints, and it will reduce them
    to the simplest representation.
    
    Logically impossible constraints will be identified immediately by thrown
    exceptions.
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =head2 new
    
      my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->new;
    
    This returns a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object.  It takes an optional
    hash reference argument.  Currently, only one key is supported:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    C<bad_version_hook> -- if provided, when a version cannot be parsed into a version object, this code reference will be called with the invalid version string as first argument, and the module name as second argument.  It must return a valid version object.
    
    =back
    
    All other keys are ignored.
    
    =head2 add_minimum
    
      $req->add_minimum( $module => $version );
    
    This adds a new minimum version requirement.  If the new requirement is
    redundant to the existing specification, this has no effect.
    
    Minimum requirements are inclusive.  C<$version> is required, along with any
    greater version number.
    
    This method returns the requirements object.
    
    =head2 add_maximum
    
      $req->add_maximum( $module => $version );
    
    This adds a new maximum version requirement.  If the new requirement is
    redundant to the existing specification, this has no effect.
    
    Maximum requirements are inclusive.  No version strictly greater than the given
    version is allowed.
    
    This method returns the requirements object.
    
    =head2 add_exclusion
    
      $req->add_exclusion( $module => $version );
    
    This adds a new excluded version.  For example, you might use these three
    method calls:
    
      $req->add_minimum( $module => '1.00' );
      $req->add_maximum( $module => '1.82' );
    
      $req->add_exclusion( $module => '1.75' );
    
    Any version between 1.00 and 1.82 inclusive would be acceptable, except for
    1.75.
    
    This method returns the requirements object.
    
    =head2 exact_version
    
      $req->exact_version( $module => $version );
    
    This sets the version required for the given module to I<exactly> the given
    version.  No other version would be considered acceptable.
    
    This method returns the requirements object.
    
    =head2 add_requirements
    
      $req->add_requirements( $another_req_object );
    
    This method adds all the requirements in the given CPAN::Meta::Requirements object
    to the requirements object on which it was called.  If there are any conflicts,
    an exception is thrown.
    
    This method returns the requirements object.
    
    =head2 accepts_module
    
      my $bool = $req->accepts_module($module => $version);
    
    Given an module and version, this method returns true if the version
    specification for the module accepts the provided version.  In other words,
    given:
    
      Module => '>= 1.00, < 2.00'
    
    We will accept 1.00 and 1.75 but not 0.50 or 2.00.
    
    For modules that do not appear in the requirements, this method will return
    true.
    
    =head2 clear_requirement
    
      $req->clear_requirement( $module );
    
    This removes the requirement for a given module from the object.
    
    This method returns the requirements object.
    
    =head2 requirements_for_module
    
      $req->requirements_for_module( $module );
    
    This returns a string containing the version requirements for a given module in
    the format described in L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> or undef if the given module has no
    requirements. This should only be used for informational purposes such as error
    messages and should not be interpreted or used for comparison (see
    L</accepts_module> instead.)
    
    =head2 required_modules
    
    This method returns a list of all the modules for which requirements have been
    specified.
    
    =head2 clone
    
      $req->clone;
    
    This method returns a clone of the invocant.  The clone and the original object
    can then be changed independent of one another.
    
    =head2 is_simple
    
    This method returns true if and only if all requirements are inclusive minimums
    -- that is, if their string expression is just the version number.
    
    =head2 is_finalized
    
    This method returns true if the requirements have been finalized by having the
    C<finalize> method called on them.
    
    =head2 finalize
    
    This method marks the requirements finalized.  Subsequent attempts to change
    the requirements will be fatal, I<if> they would result in a change.  If they
    would not alter the requirements, they have no effect.
    
    If a finalized set of requirements is cloned, the cloned requirements are not
    also finalized.
    
    =head2 as_string_hash
    
    This returns a reference to a hash describing the requirements using the
    strings in the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> specification.
    
    For example after the following program:
    
      my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->new;
    
      $req->add_minimum('CPAN::Meta::Requirements' => 0.102);
    
      $req->add_minimum('Library::Foo' => 1.208);
    
      $req->add_maximum('Library::Foo' => 2.602);
    
      $req->add_minimum('Module::Bar'  => 'v1.2.3');
    
      $req->add_exclusion('Module::Bar'  => 'v1.2.8');
    
      $req->exact_version('Xyzzy'  => '6.01');
    
      my $hashref = $req->as_string_hash;
    
    C<$hashref> would contain:
    
      {
        'CPAN::Meta::Requirements' => '0.102',
        'Library::Foo' => '>= 1.208, <= 2.206',
        'Module::Bar'  => '>= v1.2.3, != v1.2.8',
        'Xyzzy'        => '== 6.01',
      }
    
    =head2 add_string_requirement
    
      $req->add_string_requirement('Library::Foo' => '>= 1.208, <= 2.206');
      $req->add_string_requirement('Library::Foo' => v1.208);
    
    This method parses the passed in string and adds the appropriate requirement
    for the given module.  A version can be a Perl "v-string".  It understands
    version ranges as described in the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec/Version Ranges>. For
    example:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item 1.3
    
    =item >= 1.3
    
    =item <= 1.3
    
    =item == 1.3
    
    =item != 1.3
    
    =item > 1.3
    
    =item < 1.3
    
    =item >= 1.3, != 1.5, <= 2.0
    
    A version number without an operator is equivalent to specifying a minimum
    (C<E<gt>=>).  Extra whitespace is allowed.
    
    =back
    
    =head2 from_string_hash
    
      my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->from_string_hash( \%hash );
      my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->from_string_hash( \%hash, \%opts );
    
    This is an alternate constructor for a CPAN::Meta::Requirements
    object. It takes a hash of module names and version requirement
    strings and returns a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object. As with
    add_string_requirement, a version can be a Perl "v-string". Optionally,
    you can supply a hash-reference of options, exactly as with the L</new>
    method.

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This document describes version 2 of the CPAN distribution metadata
    specification, also known as the "CPAN Meta Spec".
    
    Revisions of this specification for typo corrections and prose
    clarifications may be issued as CPAN::Meta::Spec 2.I<x>.  These
    revisions will never change semantics or add or remove specified
    behavior.
    
    Distribution metadata describe important properties of Perl
    distributions. Distribution building tools like Module::Build,
    Module::Install, ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Dist::Zilla should create a
    metadata file in accordance with this specification and include it with
    the distribution for use by automated tools that index, examine, package
    or install Perl distributions.
    
    =head1 TERMINOLOGY
    
    =over 4
    
    =item distribution
    
    This is the primary object described by the metadata. In the context of
    this document it usually refers to a collection of modules, scripts,
    and/or documents that are distributed together for other developers to
    use.  Examples of distributions are C<Class-Container>, C<libwww-perl>,
    or C<DBI>.
    
    =item module
    
    This refers to a reusable library of code contained in a single file.
    Modules usually contain one or more packages and are often referred
    to by the name of a primary package that can be mapped to the file
    name. For example, one might refer to C<File::Spec> instead of
    F<File/Spec.pm>
    
    =item package
    
    This refers to a namespace declared with the Perl C<package> statement.
    In Perl, packages often have a version number property given by the
    C<$VERSION> variable in the namespace.
    
    =item consumer
    
    This refers to code that reads a metadata file, deserializes it into a
    data structure in memory, or interprets a data structure of metadata
    elements.
    
    =item producer
    
    This refers to code that constructs a metadata data structure,
    serializes into a bytestream and/or writes it to disk.
    
    =item must, should, may, etc.
    
    These terms are interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.
    
    =back
    
    =head1 DATA TYPES
    
    Fields in the L</STRUCTURE> section describe data elements, each of
    which has an associated data type as described herein.  There are four
    primitive types: Boolean, String, List and Map.  Other types are
    subtypes of primitives and define compound data structures or define
    constraints on the values of a data element.
    
    =head2 Boolean
    
    A I<Boolean> is used to provide a true or false value.  It B<must> be
    represented as a defined value.
    
    =head2 String
    
    A I<String> is data element containing a non-zero length sequence of
    Unicode characters, such as an ordinary Perl scalar that is not a
    reference.
    
    =head2 List
    
    A I<List> is an ordered collection of zero or more data elements.
    Elements of a List may be of mixed types.
    
    Producers B<must> represent List elements using a data structure which
    unambiguously indicates that multiple values are possible, such as a
    reference to a Perl array (an "arrayref").
    
    Consumers expecting a List B<must> consider a String as equivalent to a
    List of length 1.
    
    =head2 Map
    
    A I<Map> is an unordered collection of zero or more data elements
    ("values"), indexed by associated String elements ("keys").  The Map's
    value elements may be of mixed types.
    
    =head2 License String
    
    A I<License String> is a subtype of String with a restricted set of
    values.  Valid values are described in detail in the description of
    the L</license> field.
    
    =head2 URL
    
    I<URL> is a subtype of String containing a Uniform Resource Locator or
    Identifier.  [ This type is called URL and not URI for historical reasons. ]
    
    =head2 Version
    
    A I<Version> is a subtype of String containing a value that describes
    the version number of packages or distributions.  Restrictions on format
    are described in detail in the L</Version Formats> section.
    
    =head2 Version Range
    
    The I<Version Range> type is a subtype of String.  It describes a range
    of Versions that may be present or installed to fulfill prerequisites.
    It is specified in detail in the L</Version Ranges> section.
    
    =head1 STRUCTURE
    
    The metadata structure is a data element of type Map.  This section
    describes valid keys within the Map.
    
    Any keys not described in this specification document (whether top-level
    or within compound data structures described herein) are considered
    I<custom keys> and B<must> begin with an "x" or "X" and be followed by an
    underscore; i.e. they must match the pattern: C<< qr{\Ax_}i >>.  If a
    custom key refers to a compound data structure, subkeys within it do not
    need an "x_" or "X_" prefix.
    
    Consumers of metadata may ignore any or all custom keys.  All other keys
    not described herein are invalid and should be ignored by consumers.
    Producers must not generate or output invalid keys.
    
    For each key, an example is provided followed by a description.  The
    description begins with the version of spec in which the key was added
    or in which the definition was modified, whether the key is I<required>
    or I<optional> and the data type of the corresponding data element.
    These items are in parentheses, brackets and braces, respectively.
    
    If a data type is a Map or Map subtype, valid subkeys will be described
    as well.
    
    Some fields are marked I<Deprecated>.  These are shown for historical
    context and must not be produced in or consumed from any metadata structure
    of version 2 or higher.
    
    =head2 REQUIRED FIELDS
    
    =head3 abstract
    
    Example:
    
      abstract => 'Build and install Perl modules'
    
    (Spec 1.2) [required] {String}
    
    This is a short description of the purpose of the distribution.
    
    =head3 author
    
    Example:
    
      author => [ 'Ken Williams <kwilliams@cpan.org>' ]
    
    (Spec 1.2) [required] {List of one or more Strings}
    
    This List indicates the person(s) to contact concerning the
    distribution. The preferred form of the contact string is:
    
      contact-name <email-address>
    
    This field provides a general contact list independent of other
    structured fields provided within the L</resources> field, such as
    C<bugtracker>.  The addressee(s) can be contacted for any purpose
    including but not limited to (security) problems with the distribution,
    questions about the distribution or bugs in the distribution.
    
    A distribution's original author is usually the contact listed within
    this field.  Co-maintainers, successor maintainers or mailing lists
    devoted to the distribution may also be listed in addition to or instead
    of the original author.
    
    =head3 dynamic_config
    
    Example:
    
      dynamic_config => 1
    
    (Spec 2) [required] {Boolean}
    
    A boolean flag indicating whether a F<Build.PL> or F<Makefile.PL> (or
    similar) must be executed to determine prerequisites.
    
    This field should be set to a true value if the distribution performs
    some dynamic configuration (asking questions, sensing the environment,
    etc.) as part of its configuration.  This field should be set to a false
    value to indicate that prerequisites included in metadata may be
    considered final and valid for static analysis.
    
    Note: when this field is true, post-configuration prerequisites are not
    guaranteed to bear any relation whatsoever to those stated in the metadata,
    and relying on them doing so is an error. See also
    L</Prerequisites for dynamically configured distributions> in the implementors'
    notes.
    
    This field explicitly B<does not> indicate whether installation may be
    safely performed without using a Makefile or Build file, as there may be
    special files to install or custom installation targets (e.g. for
    dual-life modules that exist on CPAN as well as in the Perl core).  This
    field only defines whether or not prerequisites are exactly as given in the
    metadata.
    
    =head3 generated_by
    
    Example:
    
      generated_by => 'Module::Build version 0.36'
    
    (Spec 1.0) [required] {String}
    
    This field indicates the tool that was used to create this metadata.
    There are no defined semantics for this field, but it is traditional to
    use a string in the form "Generating::Package version 1.23" or the
    author's name, if the file was generated by hand.
    
    =head3 license
    
    Example:
    
      license => [ 'perl_5' ]
    
      license => [ 'apache_2_0', 'mozilla_1_0' ]
    
    (Spec 2) [required] {List of one or more License Strings}
    
    One or more licenses that apply to some or all of the files in the
    distribution.  If multiple licenses are listed, the distribution
    documentation should be consulted to clarify the interpretation of
    multiple licenses.
    
    The following list of license strings are valid:
    
     string          description

     zlib            zlib License
    
    The following license strings are also valid and indicate other
    licensing not described above:
    
     string          description
     -------------   -----------------------------------------------
     open_source     Other Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license
     restricted      Requires special permission from copyright holder
     unrestricted    Not an OSI approved license, but not restricted
     unknown         License not provided in metadata
    
    All other strings are invalid in the license field.
    
    =head3 meta-spec
    
    Example:
    
      'meta-spec' => {
        version => '2',
        url     => 'http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Meta::Spec',
      }
    
    (Spec 1.2) [required] {Map}
    
    This field indicates the version of the CPAN Meta Spec that should be
    used to interpret the metadata.  Consumers must check this key as soon
    as possible and abort further metadata processing if the meta-spec
    version is not supported by the consumer.
    
    The following keys are valid, but only C<version> is required.
    
    =over
    
    =item version
    
    This subkey gives the integer I<Version> of the CPAN Meta Spec against
    which the document was generated.
    
    =item url
    
    This is a I<URL> of the metadata specification document corresponding to
    the given version.  This is strictly for human-consumption and should
    not impact the interpretation of the document.
    
    For the version 2 spec, either of these are recommended:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    C<https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec>
    
    =item *
    
    C<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Meta::Spec>
    
    =back
    
    =back
    
    =head3 name
    
    Example:
    
      name => 'Module-Build'
    
    (Spec 1.0) [required] {String}
    
    This field is the name of the distribution.  This is often created by
    taking the "main package" in the distribution and changing C<::> to
    C<->, but the name may be completely unrelated to the packages within
    the distribution.  For example, L<LWP::UserAgent> is distributed as part
    of the distribution name "libwww-perl".
    
    =head3 release_status
    
    Example:
    
      release_status => 'stable'
    
    (Spec 2) [required] {String}
    
    This field provides the  release status of this distribution.  If the
    C<version> field contains an underscore character, then
    C<release_status> B<must not> be "stable."
    
    The C<release_status> field B<must> have one of the following values:
    
    =over
    
    =item stable
    
    This indicates an ordinary, "final" release that should be indexed by PAUSE
    or other indexers.
    
    =item testing
    
    This indicates a "beta" release that is substantially complete, but has an
    elevated risk of bugs and requires additional testing.  The distribution
    should not be installed over a stable release without an explicit request
    or other confirmation from a user.  This release status may also be used
    for "release candidate" versions of a distribution.
    
    =item unstable
    
    This indicates an "alpha" release that is under active development, but has
    been released for early feedback or testing and may be missing features or
    may have serious bugs.  The distribution should not be installed over a
    stable release without an explicit request or other confirmation from a
    user.
    
    =back
    
    Consumers B<may> use this field to determine how to index the
    distribution for CPAN or other repositories in addition to or in
    replacement of heuristics based on version number or file name.
    
    =head3 version
    
    Example:
    
      version => '0.36'
    
    (Spec 1.0) [required] {Version}
    
    This field gives the version of the distribution to which the metadata
    structure refers.
    
    =head2 OPTIONAL FIELDS
    
    =head3 description
    
    Example:
    
        description =>  "Module::Build is a system for "
          . "building, testing, and installing Perl modules. "
          . "It is meant to ... blah blah blah ...",
    
    (Spec 2) [optional] {String}
    
    A longer, more complete description of the purpose or intended use of
    the distribution than the one provided by the C<abstract> key.
    
    =head3 keywords
    
    Example:
    
      keywords => [ qw/ toolchain cpan dual-life / ]
    
    (Spec 1.1) [optional] {List of zero or more Strings}
    
    A List of keywords that describe this distribution.  Keywords
    B<must not> include whitespace.
    
    =head3 no_index
    
    Example:
    
      no_index => {
        file      => [ 'My/Module.pm' ],
        directory => [ 'My/Private' ],
        package   => [ 'My::Module::Secret' ],
        namespace => [ 'My::Module::Sample' ],
      }
    
    (Spec 1.2) [optional] {Map}
    
    This Map describes any files, directories, packages, and namespaces that
    are private to the packaging or implementation of the distribution and
    should be ignored by indexing or search tools. Note that this is a list of
    exclusions, and the spec does not define what to I<include> - see
    L</Indexing distributions a la PAUSE> in the implementors notes for more
    information.
    
    Valid subkeys are as follows:
    
    =over
    
    =item file
    
    A I<List> of relative paths to files.  Paths B<must be> specified with
    unix conventions.
    
    =item directory
    
    A I<List> of relative paths to directories.  Paths B<must be> specified
    with unix conventions.
    
    [ Note: previous editions of the spec had C<dir> instead of C<directory> ]
    
    =item package
    
    A I<List> of package names.
    
    =item namespace
    
    A I<List> of package namespaces, where anything below the namespace
    must be ignored, but I<not> the namespace itself.
    
    In the example above for C<no_index>, C<My::Module::Sample::Foo> would
    be ignored, but C<My::Module::Sample> would not.
    
    =back
    
    =head3 optional_features
    
    Example:
    
      optional_features => {
        sqlite => {
          description => 'Provides SQLite support',
          prereqs => {
            runtime => {
              requires => {
                'DBD::SQLite' => '1.25'
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    
    (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}
    
    This Map describes optional features with incremental prerequisites.
    Each key of the C<optional_features> Map is a String used to identify
    the feature and each value is a Map with additional information about
    the feature.  Valid subkeys include:
    
    =over
    
    =item description
    
    This is a String describing the feature.  Every optional feature
    should provide a description
    
    =item prereqs
    
    This entry is required and has the same structure as that of the
    C<L</prereqs>> key.  It provides a list of package requirements
    that must be satisfied for the feature to be supported or enabled.
    
    There is one crucial restriction:  the prereqs of an optional feature
    B<must not> include C<configure> phase prereqs.
    
    =back
    
    Consumers B<must not> include optional features as prerequisites without
    explicit instruction from users (whether via interactive prompting,
    a function parameter or a configuration value, etc. ).
    
    If an optional feature is used by a consumer to add additional
    prerequisites, the consumer should merge the optional feature
    prerequisites into those given by the C<prereqs> key using the same
    semantics.  See L</Merging and Resolving Prerequisites> for details on
    merging prerequisites.
    
    I<Suggestion for disuse:> Because there is currently no way for a
    distribution to specify a dependency on an optional feature of another
    dependency, the use of C<optional_feature> is discouraged.  Instead,
    create a separate, installable distribution that ensures the desired
    feature is available.  For example, if C<Foo::Bar> has a C<Baz> feature,
    release a separate C<Foo-Bar-Baz> distribution that satisfies
    requirements for the feature.
    
    =head3 prereqs
    
    Example:
    
      prereqs => {
        runtime => {
          requires => {
            'perl'          => '5.006',
            'File::Spec'    => '0.86',
            'JSON'          => '2.16',
          },
          recommends => {
            'JSON::XS'      => '2.26',
          },
          suggests => {
            'Archive::Tar'  => '0',
          },
        },
        build => {
          requires => {
            'Alien::SDL'    => '1.00',
          },
        },
        test => {
          recommends => {
            'Test::Deep'    => '0.10',
          },
        }
      }
    
    (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}
    
    This is a Map that describes all the prerequisites of the distribution.
    The keys are phases of activity, such as C<configure>, C<build>, C<test>
    or C<runtime>.  Values are Maps in which the keys name the type of
    prerequisite relationship such as C<requires>, C<recommends>, or
    C<suggests> and the value provides a set of prerequisite relations.  The
    set of relations B<must> be specified as a Map of package names to
    version ranges.
    
    The full definition for this field is given in the L</Prereq Spec>
    section.
    
    =head3 provides
    
    Example:
    
      provides => {
        'Foo::Bar' => {
          file    => 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm',
          version => '0.27_02',
        },
        'Foo::Bar::Blah' => {
          file    => 'lib/Foo/Bar/Blah.pm',
        },
        'Foo::Bar::Baz' => {
          file    => 'lib/Foo/Bar/Baz.pm',
          version => '0.3',
        },
      }
    
    (Spec 1.2) [optional] {Map}
    
    This describes all packages provided by this distribution.  This
    information is used by distribution and automation mechanisms like
    PAUSE, CPAN, metacpan.org and search.cpan.org to build indexes saying in
    which distribution various packages can be found.
    
    The keys of C<provides> are package names that can be found within
    the distribution.  If a package name key is provided, it must
    have a Map with the following valid subkeys:
    
    =over
    
    =item file
    
    This field is required.  It must contain a Unix-style relative file path
    from the root of the distribution directory to a file that contains or
    generates the package.  It may be given as C<META.yml> or C<META.json>
    to claim a package for indexing without needing a C<*.pm>.
    
    =item version
    
    If it exists, this field must contains a I<Version> String for the
    package.  If the package does not have a C<$VERSION>, this field must
    be omitted.
    
    =back
    
    =head3 resources
    
    Example:
    
      resources => {
        license     => [ 'http://dev.perl.org/licenses/' ],
        homepage    => 'http://sourceforge.net/projects/module-build',
        bugtracker  => {
          web    => 'http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=CPAN-Meta',
          mailto => 'meta-bugs@example.com',
        },
        repository  => {
          url  => 'git://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta.git',
          web  => 'http://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta',
          type => 'git',
        },
        x_twitter   => 'http://twitter.com/cpan_linked/',
      }
    
    (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}
    
    This field describes resources related to this distribution.
    
    Valid subkeys include:
    
    =over
    
    =item homepage

    A List of I<URL>'s that relate to this distribution's license.  As with the
    top-level C<license> field, distribution documentation should be consulted
    to clarify the interpretation of multiple licenses provided here.
    
    =item bugtracker
    
    This entry describes the bug tracking system for this distribution.  It
    is a Map with the following valid keys:
    
      web    - a URL pointing to a web front-end for the bug tracker
      mailto - an email address to which bugs can be sent
    
    =item repository
    
    This entry describes the source control repository for this distribution.  It
    is a Map with the following valid keys:
    
      url  - a URL pointing to the repository itself
      web  - a URL pointing to a web front-end for the repository
      type - a lowercase string indicating the VCS used
    
    Because a url like C<http://myrepo.example.com/> is ambiguous as to
    type, producers should provide a C<type> whenever a C<url> key is given.
    The C<type> field should be the name of the most common program used
    to work with the repository, e.g. C<git>, C<svn>, C<cvs>, C<darcs>,
    C<bzr> or C<hg>.

    =head1 VERSION NUMBERS
    
    =head2 Version Formats
    
    This section defines the Version type, used by several fields in the
    CPAN Meta Spec.
    
    Version numbers must be treated as strings, not numbers.  For
    example, C<1.200> B<must not> be serialized as C<1.2>.  Version
    comparison should be delegated to the Perl L<version> module, version
    0.80 or newer.
    
    Unless otherwise specified, version numbers B<must> appear in one of two
    formats:
    
    =over
    
    =item Decimal versions
    
    Decimal versions are regular "decimal numbers", with some limitations.
    They B<must> be non-negative and B<must> begin and end with a digit.  A
    single underscore B<may> be included, but B<must> be between two digits.
    They B<must not> use exponential notation ("1.23e-2").
    
       version => '1.234'       # OK
       version => '1.23_04'     # OK
    
       version => '1.23_04_05'  # Illegal
       version => '1.'          # Illegal
       version => '.1'          # Illegal
    
    =item Dotted-integer versions
    
    Dotted-integer (also known as dotted-decimal) versions consist of
    positive integers separated by full stop characters (i.e. "dots",
    "periods" or "decimal points").  This are equivalent in format to Perl
    "v-strings", with some additional restrictions on form.  They must be
    given in "normal" form, which has a leading "v" character and at least
    three integer components.  To retain a one-to-one mapping with decimal
    versions, all components after the first B<should> be restricted to the
    range 0 to 999.  The final component B<may> be separated by an
    underscore character instead of a period.
    
       version => 'v1.2.3'      # OK
       version => 'v1.2_3'      # OK
       version => 'v1.2.3.4'    # OK
       version => 'v1.2.3_4'    # OK
       version => 'v2009.10.31' # OK
    
       version => 'v1.2'          # Illegal
       version => '1.2.3'         # Illegal
       version => 'v1.2_3_4'      # Illegal
       version => 'v1.2009.10.31' # Not recommended
    
    =back
    
    =head2 Version Ranges
    
    Some fields (prereq, optional_features) indicate the particular
    version(s) of some other module that may be required as a prerequisite.
    This section details the Version Range type used to provide this
    information.
    
    The simplest format for a Version Range is just the version
    number itself, e.g. C<2.4>.  This means that B<at least> version 2.4
    must be present.  To indicate that B<any> version of a prerequisite is
    okay, even if the prerequisite doesn't define a version at all, use
    the version C<0>.
    
    Alternatively, a version range B<may> use the operators E<lt> (less than),
    E<lt>= (less than or equal), E<gt> (greater than), E<gt>= (greater than
    or equal), == (equal), and != (not equal).  For example, the
    specification C<E<lt> 2.0> means that any version of the prerequisite
    less than 2.0 is suitable.
    
    For more complicated situations, version specifications B<may> be AND-ed
    together using commas.  The specification C<E<gt>= 1.2, != 1.5, E<lt>
    2.0> indicates a version that must be B<at least> 1.2, B<less than> 2.0,
    and B<not equal to> 1.5.
    
    =head1 PREREQUISITES
    
    =head2 Prereq Spec
    
    The C<prereqs> key in the top-level metadata and within
    C<optional_features> define the relationship between a distribution and
    other packages.  The prereq spec structure is a hierarchical data
    structure which divides prerequisites into I<Phases> of activity in the
    installation process and I<Relationships> that indicate how
    prerequisites should be resolved.
    
    For example, to specify that C<Data::Dumper> is C<required> during the
    C<test> phase, this entry would appear in the distribution metadata:
    
      prereqs => {
        test => {
          requires => {
            'Data::Dumper' => '2.00'
          }
        }
      }
    
    =head3 Phases
    
    Requirements for regular use must be listed in the C<runtime> phase.
    Other requirements should be listed in the earliest stage in which they
    are required and consumers must accumulate and satisfy requirements
    across phases before executing the activity. For example, C<build>
    requirements must also be available during the C<test> phase.
    
      before action       requirements that must be met
      ----------------    --------------------------------
      perl Build.PL       configure
      perl Makefile.PL
    
      make                configure, runtime, build
      Build
    
      make test           configure, runtime, build, test
      Build test
    
    Consumers that install the distribution must ensure that
    I<runtime> requirements are also installed and may install
    dependencies from other phases.
    
      after action        requirements that must be met
      ----------------    --------------------------------
      make install        runtime
      Build install
    
    =over
    
    =item configure
    
    The configure phase occurs before any dynamic configuration has been
    attempted.  Libraries required by the configure phase B<must> be
    available for use before the distribution building tool has been
    executed.
    
    =item build
    
    The build phase is when the distribution's source code is compiled (if
    necessary) and otherwise made ready for installation.
    
    =item test
    
    The test phase is when the distribution's automated test suite is run.
    Any library that is needed only for testing and not for subsequent use
    should be listed here.
    
    =item runtime
    
    The runtime phase refers not only to when the distribution's contents
    are installed, but also to its continued use.  Any library that is a
    prerequisite for regular use of this distribution should be indicated
    here.
    
    =item develop
    
    The develop phase's prereqs are libraries needed to work on the
    distribution's source code as its author does.  These tools might be
    needed to build a release tarball, to run author-only tests, or to
    perform other tasks related to developing new versions of the
    distribution.
    
    =back
    
    =head3 Relationships
    
    =over
    
    =item requires
    
    These dependencies B<must> be installed for proper completion of the
    phase.
    
    =item recommends
    
    Recommended dependencies are I<strongly> encouraged and should be
    satisfied except in resource constrained environments.
    
    =item suggests
    
    These dependencies are optional, but are suggested for enhanced operation
    of the described distribution.
    
    =item conflicts
    
    These libraries cannot be installed when the phase is in operation.
    This is a very rare situation, and the C<conflicts> relationship should
    be used with great caution, or not at all.
    
    =back
    
    =head2 Merging and Resolving Prerequisites
    
    Whenever metadata consumers merge prerequisites, either from different
    phases or from C<optional_features>, they should merged in a way which
    preserves the intended semantics of the prerequisite structure.  Generally,
    this means concatenating the version specifications using commas, as
    described in the L<Version Ranges> section.
    
    Another subtle error that can occur in resolving prerequisites comes from
    the way that modules in prerequisites are indexed to distribution files on
    CPAN.  When a module is deleted from a distribution, prerequisites calling
    for that module could indicate an older distribution should be installed,
    potentially overwriting files from a newer distribution.
    
    For example, as of Oct 31, 2009, the CPAN index file contained these
    module-distribution mappings:
    
      Class::MOP                   0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz
      Class::MOP::Class            0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz
      Class::MOP::Class::Immutable 0.04  S/ST/STEVAN/Class-MOP-0.36.tar.gz
    
    Consider the case where "Class::MOP" 0.94 is installed.  If a
    distribution specified "Class::MOP::Class::Immutable" as a prerequisite,
    it could result in Class-MOP-0.36.tar.gz being installed, overwriting
    any files from Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz.
    
    Consumers of metadata B<should> test whether prerequisites would result
    in installed module files being "downgraded" to an older version and
    B<may> warn users or ignore the prerequisite that would cause such a
    result.
    
    =head1 SERIALIZATION
    
    Distribution metadata should be serialized (as a hashref) as
    JSON-encoded data and packaged with distributions as the file
    F<META.json>.
    
    In the past, the distribution metadata structure had been packed with
    distributions as F<META.yml>, a file in the YAML Tiny format (for which,
    see L<YAML::Tiny>).  Tools that consume distribution metadata from disk
    should be capable of loading F<META.yml>, but should prefer F<META.json>
    if both are found.
    
    =head1 NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTORS
    
    =head2 Extracting Version Numbers from Perl Modules
    
    To get the version number from a Perl module, consumers should use the
    C<< MM->parse_version($file) >> method provided by
    L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> or L<Module::Metadata>.  For example, for the
    module given by C<$mod>, the version may be retrieved in one of the
    following ways:
    
      # via ExtUtils::MakeMaker
      my $file = MM->_installed_file_for_module($mod);
      my $version = MM->parse_version($file)
    
    The private C<_installed_file_for_module> method may be replaced with
    other methods for locating a module in C<@INC>.
    
      # via Module::Metadata
      my $info = Module::Metadata->new_from_module($mod);
      my $version = $info->version;
    
    If only a filename is available, the following approach may be used:
    
      # via Module::Build
      my $info = Module::Metadata->new_from_file($file);
      my $version = $info->version;
    
    =head2 Comparing Version Numbers
    
    The L<version> module provides the most reliable way to compare version
    numbers in all the various ways they might be provided or might exist
    within modules.  Given two strings containing version numbers, C<$v1> and
    C<$v2>, they should be converted to C<version> objects before using
    ordinary comparison operators.  For example:
    
      use version;
      if ( version->new($v1) <=> version->new($v2) ) {
        print "Versions are not equal\n";
      }
    
    If the only comparison needed is whether an installed module is of a
    sufficiently high version, a direct test may be done using the string
    form of C<eval> and the C<use> function.  For example, for module C<$mod>
    and version prerequisite C<$prereq>:
    
      if ( eval "use $mod $prereq (); 1" ) {
        print "Module $mod version is OK.\n";
      }
    
    If the values of C<$mod> and C<$prereq> have not been scrubbed, however,
    this presents security implications.
    
    =head2 Prerequisites for dynamically configured distributions
    
    When C<dynamic_config> is true, it is an error to presume that the
    prerequisites given in distribution metadata will have any relationship
    whatsoever to the actual prerequisites of the distribution.
    
    In practice, however, one can generally expect such prerequisites to be
    one of two things:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    The minimum prerequisites for the distribution, to which dynamic configuration will only add items
    
    =item *
    
    Whatever the distribution configured with on the releaser's machine at release time
    
    =back
    
    The second case often turns out to have identical results to the first case,
    albeit only by accident.
    
    As such, consumers may use this data for informational analysis, but
    presenting it to the user as canonical or relying on it as such is
    invariably the height of folly.
    
    =head2 Indexing distributions a la PAUSE
    
    While no_index tells you what must be ignored when indexing, this spec holds
    no opinion on how you should get your initial candidate list of things to
    possibly index. For "normal" distributions you might consider simply indexing
    the contents of lib/, but there are many fascinating oddities on CPAN and
    many dists from the days when it was normal to put the main .pm file in the
    root of the distribution archive - so PAUSE currently indexes all .pm and .PL
    files that are not either (a) specifically excluded by no_index (b) in
    C<inc>, C<xt>, or C<t> directories, or common 'mistake' directories such as
    C<perl5>.
    
    Or: If you're trying to be PAUSE-like, make sure you skip C<inc>, C<xt> and
    C<t> as well as anything marked as no_index.
    
    Also remember: If the META file contains a provides field, you shouldn't be
    indexing anything in the first place - just use that.

    =head1 HISTORY
    
    Ken Williams wrote the original CPAN Meta Spec (also known as the
    "META.yml spec") in 2003 and maintained it through several revisions
    with input from various members of the community.  In 2005, Randy
    Sims redrafted it from HTML to POD for the version 1.2 release.  Ken
    continued to maintain the spec through version 1.4.
    
    In late 2009, David Golden organized the version 2 proposal review
    process.  David and Ricardo Signes drafted the final version 2 spec
    in April 2010 based on the version 1.4 spec and patches contributed
    during the proposal process.

    check_map($spec,$data)
    
    Checks whether a map (or hash) part of the data structure conforms to the
    appropriate specification definition.
    
    =item *
    
    check_list($spec,$data)

    =head2 Validator Methods
    
    =over
    
    =item *
    
    header($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that the header is valid.
    
    Note: No longer used as we now read the data structure, not the file.
    
    =item *
    
    url($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that a given value is in an acceptable URL format
    
    =item *
    
    urlspec($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that the URL to a META specification is a known one.
    
    =item *
    
    string_or_undef($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that the value is either a string or an undef value. Bit of a
    catchall function for parts of the data structure that are completely user
    defined.
    
    =item *
    
    string($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that a string exists for the given key.
    
    =item *
    
    file($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validate that a file is passed for the given key. This may be made more
    thorough in the future. For now it acts like \&string.
    
    =item *
    
    exversion($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates a list of versions, e.g. '<= 5, >=2, ==3, !=4, >1, <6, 0'.
    
    =item *
    
    version($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates a single version string. Versions of the type '5.8.8' and '0.00_00'
    are both valid. A leading 'v' like 'v1.2.3' is also valid.
    
    =item *
    
    boolean($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates for a boolean value. Currently these values are '1', '0', 'true',
    'false', however the latter 2 may be removed.
    
    =item *
    
    license($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that a value is given for the license. Returns 1 if an known license
    type, or 2 if a value is given but the license type is not a recommended one.
    
    =item *
    
    custom_1($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that the given key is in CamelCase, to indicate a user defined
    keyword and only has characters in the class [-_a-zA-Z].  In version 1.X
    of the spec, this was only explicitly stated for 'resources'.
    
    =item *
    
    custom_2($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that the given key begins with 'x_' or 'X_', to indicate a user
    defined keyword and only has characters in the class [-_a-zA-Z]
    
    =item *
    
    identifier($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that key is in an acceptable format for the META specification,
    for an identifier, i.e. any that matches the regular expression
    qr/[a-z][a-z_]/i.
    
    =item *
    
    module($self,$key,$value)
    
    Validates that a given key is in an acceptable module name format, e.g.
    'Test::CPAN::Meta::Version'.

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This module implements a subset of the YAML specification for use in reading
    and writing CPAN metadata files like F<META.yml> and F<MYMETA.yml>.  It should
    not be used for any other general YAML parsing or generation task.
    
    NOTE: F<META.yml> (and F<MYMETA.yml>) files should be UTF-8 encoded.  Users are
    responsible for proper encoding and decoding.  In particular, the C<read> and
    C<write> methods do B<not> support UTF-8 and should not be used.
    
    =head1 SUPPORT
    
    This module is currently derived from L<YAML::Tiny> by Adam Kennedy.  If
    there are bugs in how it parses a particular META.yml file, please file
    a bug report in the YAML::Tiny bugtracker:

    Exporter - Implements default import method for modules
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    In module F<YourModule.pm>:
    
      package YourModule;
      require Exporter;
      @ISA = qw(Exporter);
      @EXPORT_OK = qw(munge frobnicate);  # symbols to export on request
    
    or
    
      package YourModule;
      use Exporter 'import'; # gives you Exporter's import() method directly
      @EXPORT_OK = qw(munge frobnicate);  # symbols to export on request
    
    In other files which wish to use C<YourModule>:
    
      use YourModule qw(frobnicate);      # import listed symbols
      frobnicate ($left, $right)          # calls YourModule::frobnicate
    
    Take a look at L</Good Practices> for some variants
    you will like to use in modern Perl code.
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    The Exporter module implements an C<import> method which allows a module
    to export functions and variables to its users' namespaces.  Many modules
    use Exporter rather than implementing their own C<import> method because
    Exporter provides a highly flexible interface, with an implementation optimised
    for the common case.
    
    Perl automatically calls the C<import> method when processing a
    C<use> statement for a module.  Modules and C<use> are documented
    in L<perlfunc> and L<perlmod>.  Understanding the concept of
    modules and how the C<use> statement operates is important to
    understanding the Exporter.
    
    =head2 How to Export
    
    The arrays C<@EXPORT> and C<@EXPORT_OK> in a module hold lists of
    symbols that are going to be exported into the users name space by
    default, or which they can request to be exported, respectively.  The
    symbols can represent functions, scalars, arrays, hashes, or typeglobs.
    The symbols must be given by full name with the exception that the
    ampersand in front of a function is optional, e.g.
    
        @EXPORT    = qw(afunc $scalar @array);   # afunc is a function
        @EXPORT_OK = qw(&bfunc %hash *typeglob); # explicit prefix on &bfunc
    
    If you are only exporting function names it is recommended to omit the
    ampersand, as the implementation is faster this way.
    
    =head2 Selecting What to Export
    
    Do B<not> export method names!
    
    Do B<not> export anything else by default without a good reason!
    
    Exports pollute the namespace of the module user.  If you must export
    try to use C<@EXPORT_OK> in preference to C<@EXPORT> and avoid short or
    common symbol names to reduce the risk of name clashes.
    
    Generally anything not exported is still accessible from outside the
    module using the C<YourModule::item_name> (or C<< $blessed_ref->method >>)
    syntax.  By convention you can use a leading underscore on names to
    informally indicate that they are 'internal' and not for public use.
    
    (It is actually possible to get private functions by saying:
    
      my $subref = sub { ... };
      $subref->(@args);            # Call it as a function
      $obj->$subref(@args);        # Use it as a method
    
    However if you use them for methods it is up to you to figure out
    how to make inheritance work.)
    
    As a general rule, if the module is trying to be object oriented
    then export nothing.  If it's just a collection of functions then
    C<@EXPORT_OK> anything but use C<@EXPORT> with caution.  For function and
    method names use barewords in preference to names prefixed with
    ampersands for the export lists.
    
    Other module design guidelines can be found in L<perlmod>.
    
    =head2 How to Import
    
    In other files which wish to use your module there are three basic ways for
    them to load your module and import its symbols:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item C<use YourModule;>
    
    This imports all the symbols from YourModule's C<@EXPORT> into the namespace
    of the C<use> statement.
    
    =item C<use YourModule ();>
    
    This causes perl to load your module but does not import any symbols.
    
    =item C<use YourModule qw(...);>
    
    This imports only the symbols listed by the caller into their namespace.
    All listed symbols must be in your C<@EXPORT> or C<@EXPORT_OK>, else an error
    occurs.  The advanced export features of Exporter are accessed like this,
    but with list entries that are syntactically distinct from symbol names.
    
    =back
    
    Unless you want to use its advanced features, this is probably all you
    need to know to use Exporter.
    
    =head1 Advanced Features
    
    =head2 Specialised Import Lists
    
    If any of the entries in an import list begins with !, : or / then
    the list is treated as a series of specifications which either add to
    or delete from the list of names to import.  They are processed left to
    right. Specifications are in the form:
    
        [!]name         This name only
        [!]:DEFAULT     All names in @EXPORT
        [!]:tag         All names in $EXPORT_TAGS{tag} anonymous list
        [!]/pattern/    All names in @EXPORT and @EXPORT_OK which match
    
    A leading ! indicates that matching names should be deleted from the
    list of names to import.  If the first specification is a deletion it
    is treated as though preceded by :DEFAULT.  If you just want to import
    extra names in addition to the default set you will still need to
    include :DEFAULT explicitly.
    
    e.g., F<Module.pm> defines:
    
        @EXPORT      = qw(A1 A2 A3 A4 A5);
        @EXPORT_OK   = qw(B1 B2 B3 B4 B5);
        %EXPORT_TAGS = (T1 => [qw(A1 A2 B1 B2)], T2 => [qw(A1 A2 B3 B4)]);
    
    Note that you cannot use tags in @EXPORT or @EXPORT_OK.
    
    Names in EXPORT_TAGS must also appear in @EXPORT or @EXPORT_OK.
    
    An application using Module can say something like:
    
        use Module qw(:DEFAULT :T2 !B3 A3);
    
    Other examples include:
    
        use Socket qw(!/^[AP]F_/ !SOMAXCONN !SOL_SOCKET);
        use POSIX  qw(:errno_h :termios_h !TCSADRAIN !/^EXIT/);
    
    Remember that most patterns (using //) will need to be anchored
    with a leading ^, e.g., C</^EXIT/> rather than C</EXIT/>.
    
    You can say C<BEGIN { $Exporter::Verbose=1 }> to see how the
    specifications are being processed and what is actually being imported
    into modules.
    
    =head2 Exporting Without Using Exporter's import Method
    
    Exporter has a special method, 'export_to_level' which is used in situations
    where you can't directly call Exporter's
    import method.  The export_to_level
    method looks like:
    
        MyPackage->export_to_level(
    	$where_to_export, $package, @what_to_export
        );
    
    where C<$where_to_export> is an integer telling how far up the calling stack
    to export your symbols, and C<@what_to_export> is an array telling what
    symbols *to* export (usually this is C<@_>).  The C<$package> argument is
    currently unused.
    
    For example, suppose that you have a module, A, which already has an
    import function:
    
        package A;
    
        @ISA = qw(Exporter);
        @EXPORT_OK = qw($b);
    
        sub import
        {
    	$A::b = 1;     # not a very useful import method
        }
    
    and you want to Export symbol C<$A::b> back to the module that called 
    package A.  Since Exporter relies on the import method to work, via 
    inheritance, as it stands Exporter::import() will never get called. 
    Instead, say the following:
    
        package A;
        @ISA = qw(Exporter);
        @EXPORT_OK = qw($b);
    
        sub import
        {
    	$A::b = 1;
    	A->export_to_level(1, @_);
        }
    
    This will export the symbols one level 'above' the current package - ie: to 
    the program or module that used package A. 
    
    Note: Be careful not to modify C<@_> at all before you call export_to_level
    - or people using your package will get very unexplained results!
    
    =head2 Exporting Without Inheriting from Exporter
    
    By including Exporter in your C<@ISA> you inherit an Exporter's import() method
    but you also inherit several other helper methods which you probably don't
    want.  To avoid this you can do:
    
      package YourModule;
      use Exporter qw(import);
    
    which will export Exporter's own import() method into YourModule.
    Everything will work as before but you won't need to include Exporter in
    C<@YourModule::ISA>.
    
    Note: This feature was introduced in version 5.57
    of Exporter, released with perl 5.8.3.
    
    =head2 Module Version Checking
    
    The Exporter module will convert an attempt to import a number from a
    module into a call to C<< $module_name->VERSION($value) >>.  This can
    be used to validate that the version of the module being used is
    greater than or equal to the required version.
    
    For historical reasons, Exporter supplies a C<require_version> method that
    simply delegates to C<VERSION>.  Originally, before C<UNIVERSAL::VERSION>
    existed, Exporter would call C<require_version>.
    
    Since the C<UNIVERSAL::VERSION> method treats the C<$VERSION> number as
    a simple numeric value it will regard version 1.10 as lower than
    1.9.  For this reason it is strongly recommended that you use numbers
    with at least two decimal places, e.g., 1.09.
    
    =head2 Managing Unknown Symbols
    
    In some situations you may want to prevent certain symbols from being
    exported.  Typically this applies to extensions which have functions
    or constants that may not exist on some systems.
    
    The names of any symbols that cannot be exported should be listed
    in the C<@EXPORT_FAIL> array.
    
    If a module attempts to import any of these symbols the Exporter
    will give the module an opportunity to handle the situation before
    generating an error.  The Exporter will call an export_fail method
    with a list of the failed symbols:
    
      @failed_symbols = $module_name->export_fail(@failed_symbols);
    
    If the C<export_fail> method returns an empty list then no error is
    recorded and all the requested symbols are exported.  If the returned
    list is not empty then an error is generated for each symbol and the
    export fails.  The Exporter provides a default C<export_fail> method which
    simply returns the list unchanged.
    
    Uses for the C<export_fail> method include giving better error messages
    for some symbols and performing lazy architectural checks (put more
    symbols into C<@EXPORT_FAIL> by default and then take them out if someone
    actually tries to use them and an expensive check shows that they are
    usable on that platform).
    
    =head2 Tag Handling Utility Functions
    
    Since the symbols listed within C<%EXPORT_TAGS> must also appear in either
    C<@EXPORT> or C<@EXPORT_OK>, two utility functions are provided which allow
    you to easily add tagged sets of symbols to C<@EXPORT> or C<@EXPORT_OK>:
    
      %EXPORT_TAGS = (foo => [qw(aa bb cc)], bar => [qw(aa cc dd)]);
    
      Exporter::export_tags('foo');     # add aa, bb and cc to @EXPORT
      Exporter::export_ok_tags('bar');  # add aa, cc and dd to @EXPORT_OK
    
    Any names which are not tags are added to C<@EXPORT> or C<@EXPORT_OK>
    unchanged but will trigger a warning (with C<-w>) to avoid misspelt tags
    names being silently added to C<@EXPORT> or C<@EXPORT_OK>.  Future versions
    may make this a fatal error.
    
    =head2 Generating Combined Tags
    
    If several symbol categories exist in C<%EXPORT_TAGS>, it's usually
    useful to create the utility ":all" to simplify "use" statements.
    
    The simplest way to do this is:
    
      %EXPORT_TAGS = (foo => [qw(aa bb cc)], bar => [qw(aa cc dd)]);
    
      # add all the other ":class" tags to the ":all" class,
      # deleting duplicates
      {
        my %seen;
    
        push @{$EXPORT_TAGS{all}},
          grep {!$seen{$_}++} @{$EXPORT_TAGS{$_}} foreach keys %EXPORT_TAGS;
      }
    
    F<CGI.pm> creates an ":all" tag which contains some (but not really
    all) of its categories.  That could be done with one small
    change:
    
      # add some of the other ":class" tags to the ":all" class,
      # deleting duplicates
      {
        my %seen;
    
        push @{$EXPORT_TAGS{all}},
          grep {!$seen{$_}++} @{$EXPORT_TAGS{$_}}
            foreach qw/html2 html3 netscape form cgi internal/;
      }
    
    Note that the tag names in C<%EXPORT_TAGS> don't have the leading ':'.
    
    =head2 C<AUTOLOAD>ed Constants
    
    Many modules make use of C<AUTOLOAD>ing for constant subroutines to
    avoid having to compile and waste memory on rarely used values (see
    L<perlsub> for details on constant subroutines).  Calls to such
    constant subroutines are not optimized away at compile time because
    they can't be checked at compile time for constancy.
    
    Even if a prototype is available at compile time, the body of the
    subroutine is not (it hasn't been C<AUTOLOAD>ed yet).  perl needs to
    examine both the C<()> prototype and the body of a subroutine at
    compile time to detect that it can safely replace calls to that
    subroutine with the constant value.
    
    A workaround for this is to call the constants once in a C<BEGIN> block:
    
       package My ;
    
       use Socket ;
    
       foo( SO_LINGER );  ## SO_LINGER NOT optimized away; called at runtime
       BEGIN { SO_LINGER }
       foo( SO_LINGER );  ## SO_LINGER optimized away at compile time.
    
    This forces the C<AUTOLOAD> for C<SO_LINGER> to take place before
    SO_LINGER is encountered later in C<My> package.
    
    If you are writing a package that C<AUTOLOAD>s, consider forcing
    an C<AUTOLOAD> for any constants explicitly imported by other packages
    or which are usually used when your package is C<use>d.
    
    =head1 Good Practices
    
    =head2 Declaring C<@EXPORT_OK> and Friends
    
    When using C<Exporter> with the standard C<strict> and C<warnings>
    pragmas, the C<our> keyword is needed to declare the package
    variables C<@EXPORT_OK>, C<@EXPORT>, C<@ISA>, etc.
    
      our @ISA = qw(Exporter);
      our @EXPORT_OK = qw(munge frobnicate);
    
    If backward compatibility for Perls under 5.6 is important,
    one must write instead a C<use vars> statement.
    
      use vars qw(@ISA @EXPORT_OK);
      @ISA = qw(Exporter);
      @EXPORT_OK = qw(munge frobnicate);
    
    =head2 Playing Safe
    
    There are some caveats with the use of runtime statements
    like C<require Exporter> and the assignment to package
    variables, which can be very subtle for the unaware programmer.
    This may happen for instance with mutually recursive
    modules, which are affected by the time the relevant
    constructions are executed.
    
    The ideal (but a bit ugly) way to never have to think
    about that is to use C<BEGIN> blocks.  So the first part
    of the L</SYNOPSIS> code could be rewritten as:
    
      package YourModule;
    
      use strict;
      use warnings;
    
      our (@ISA, @EXPORT_OK);
      BEGIN {
         require Exporter;
         @ISA = qw(Exporter);
         @EXPORT_OK = qw(munge frobnicate);  # symbols to export on request
      }
    
    The C<BEGIN> will assure that the loading of F<Exporter.pm>
    and the assignments to C<@ISA> and C<@EXPORT_OK> happen
    immediately, leaving no room for something to get awry
    or just plain wrong.
    
    With respect to loading C<Exporter> and inheriting, there
    are alternatives with the use of modules like C<base> and C<parent>.
    
      use base qw(Exporter);
      # or
      use parent qw(Exporter);
    
    Any of these statements are nice replacements for
    C<BEGIN { require Exporter; @ISA = qw(Exporter); }>
    with the same compile-time effect.  The basic difference
    is that C<base> code interacts with declared C<fields>
    while C<parent> is a streamlined version of the older
    C<base> code to just establish the IS-A relationship.
    
    For more details, see the documentation and code of
    L<base> and L<parent>.
    
    Another thorough remedy to that runtime
    vs. compile-time trap is to use L<Exporter::Easy>,
    which is a wrapper of Exporter that allows all
    boilerplate code at a single gulp in the
    use statement.
    
       use Exporter::Easy (
           OK => [ qw(munge frobnicate) ],
       );
       # @ISA setup is automatic
       # all assignments happen at compile time
    
    =head2 What Not to Export
    
    You have been warned already in L</Selecting What to Export>
    to not export:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    method names (because you don't need to
    and that's likely to not do what you want),
    
    =item *
    
    anything by default (because you don't want to surprise your users...
    badly)
    
    =item *
    
    anything you don't need to (because less is more)
    
    =back
    
    There's one more item to add to this list.  Do B<not>
    export variable names.  Just because C<Exporter> lets you
    do that, it does not mean you should.
    
      @EXPORT_OK = qw($svar @avar %hvar); # DON'T!
    
    Exporting variables is not a good idea.  They can
    change under the hood, provoking horrible
    effects at-a-distance that are too hard to track
    and to fix.  Trust me: they are not worth it.
    
    To provide the capability to set/get class-wide
    settings, it is best instead to provide accessors
    as subroutines or class methods instead.
    
    =head1 SEE ALSO

    symbol exporter capabilities.  At CPAN, you may find
    a bunch of them.  Some are lighter.  Some
    provide improved APIs and features.  Pick the one
    that fits your needs.  The following is
    a sample list of such modules.

    =head1 NAME
    
    File::pushd - change directory temporarily for a limited scope
    
    =head1 VERSION
    
    version 1.009
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
     use File::pushd;
    
     chdir $ENV{HOME};
    
     # change directory again for a limited scope
     {
         my $dir = pushd( '/tmp' );
         # working directory changed to /tmp
     }
     # working directory has reverted to $ENV{HOME}
    
     # tempd() is equivalent to pushd( File::Temp::tempdir )
     {
         my $dir = tempd();
     }
    
     # object stringifies naturally as an absolute path
     {
        my $dir = pushd( '/tmp' );
        my $filename = File::Spec->catfile( $dir, "somefile.txt" );
        # gives /tmp/somefile.txt
     }
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    File::pushd does a temporary C<chdir> that is easily and automatically
    reverted, similar to C<pushd> in some Unix command shells.  It works by
    creating an object that caches the original working directory.  When the object
    is destroyed, the destructor calls C<chdir> to revert to the original working
    directory.  By storing the object in a lexical variable with a limited scope,
    this happens automatically at the end of the scope.
    
    This is very handy when working with temporary directories for tasks like
    testing; a function is provided to streamline getting a temporary
    directory from L<File::Temp>.
    
    For convenience, the object stringifies as the canonical form of the absolute
    pathname of the directory entered.
    
    B<Warning>: if you create multiple C<pushd> objects in the same lexical scope,
    their destruction order is not guaranteed and you might not wind up in the
    directory you expect.
    
    =head1 USAGE
    
     use File::pushd;
    
    Using File::pushd automatically imports the C<pushd> and C<tempd> functions.
    
    =head2 pushd
    
     {
         my $dir = pushd( $target_directory );
     }
    
    Caches the current working directory, calls C<chdir> to change to the target
    directory, and returns a File::pushd object.  When the object is
    destroyed, the working directory reverts to the original directory.
    
    The provided target directory can be a relative or absolute path. If
    called with no arguments, it uses the current directory as its target and
    returns to the current directory when the object is destroyed.
    
    If the target directory does not exist or if the directory change fails
    for some reason, C<pushd> will die with an error message.
    
    Can be given a hashref as an optional second argument.  The only supported
    option is C<untaint_pattern>, which is used to untaint file paths involved.
    It defaults to {qr{^(L<-+@\w./>+)$}}, which is reasonably restrictive (e.g.
    it does not even allow spaces in the path).  Change this to suit your
    circumstances and security needs if running under taint mode. *Note*: you
    must include the parentheses in the pattern to capture the untainted
    portion of the path.
    
    =head2 tempd
    
     {
         my $dir = tempd();
     }
    
    This function is like C<pushd> but automatically creates and calls C<chdir> to
    a temporary directory created by L<File::Temp>. Unlike normal L<File::Temp>
    cleanup which happens at the end of the program, this temporary directory is
    removed when the object is destroyed. (But also see C<preserve>.)  A warning
    will be issued if the directory cannot be removed.
    
    As with C<pushd>, C<tempd> will die if C<chdir> fails.
    
    It may be given a single options hash that will be passed internally
    to C<pushd>.
    
    =head2 preserve
    
     {
         my $dir = tempd();
         $dir->preserve;      # mark to preserve at end of scope
         $dir->preserve(0);   # mark to delete at end of scope
     }
    
    Controls whether a temporary directory will be cleaned up when the object is
    destroyed.  With no arguments, C<preserve> sets the directory to be preserved.
    With an argument, the directory will be preserved if the argument is true, or
    marked for cleanup if the argument is false.  Only C<tempd> objects may be
    marked for cleanup.  (Target directories to C<pushd> are always preserved.)
    C<preserve> returns true if the directory will be preserved, and false
    otherwise.

    #pod     a header is an array reference, the header will be output multiple times with
    #pod     each value in the array.  These headers over-write any default headers.
    #pod * C<content> —
    #pod     A scalar to include as the body of the request OR a code reference
    #pod     that will be called iteratively to produce the body of the request
    #pod * C<trailer_callback> —
    #pod     A code reference that will be called if it exists to provide a hashref
    #pod     of trailing headers (only used with chunked transfer-encoding)
    #pod * C<data_callback> —
    #pod     A code reference that will be called for each chunks of the response
    #pod     body received.
    #pod
    #pod The C<Host> header is generated from the URL in accordance with RFC 2616.  It
    #pod is a fatal error to specify C<Host> in the C<headers> option.  Other headers
    #pod may be ignored or overwritten if necessary for transport compliance.
    #pod
    #pod If the C<content> option is a code reference, it will be called iteratively
    #pod to provide the content body of the request.  It should return the empty
    #pod string or undef when the iterator is exhausted.
    #pod
    #pod If the C<content> option is the empty string, no C<content-type> or
    #pod C<content-length> headers will be generated.
    #pod
    #pod If the C<data_callback> option is provided, it will be called iteratively until
    #pod the entire response body is received.  The first argument will be a string
    #pod containing a chunk of the response body, the second argument will be the
    #pod in-progress response hash reference, as described below.  (This allows
    #pod customizing the action of the callback based on the C<status> or C<headers>
    #pod received prior to the content body.)
    #pod
    #pod The C<request> method returns a hashref containing the response.  The hashref
    #pod will have the following keys:
    #pod
    #pod =for :list
    #pod * C<success> —
    #pod     Boolean indicating whether the operation returned a 2XX status code
    #pod * C<url> —
    #pod     URL that provided the response. This is the URL of the request unless
    #pod     there were redirections, in which case it is the last URL queried
    #pod     in a redirection chain
    #pod * C<status> —
    #pod     The HTTP status code of the response
    #pod * C<reason> —
    #pod     The response phrase returned by the server
    #pod * C<content> —
    #pod     The body of the response.  If the response does not have any content
    #pod     or if a data callback is provided to consume the response body,
    #pod     this will be the empty string
    #pod * C<headers> —
    #pod     A hashref of header fields.  All header field names will be normalized
    #pod     to be lower case. If a header is repeated, the value will be an arrayref;
    #pod     it will otherwise be a scalar string containing the value
    #pod
    #pod On an exception during the execution of the request, the C<status> field will
    #pod contain 599, and the C<content> field will contain the text of the exception.

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This is a very simple HTTP/1.1 client, designed for doing simple
    requests without the overhead of a large framework like L<LWP::UserAgent>.
    
    It is more correct and more complete than L<HTTP::Lite>.  It supports
    proxies and redirection.  It also correctly resumes after EINTR.
    
    If L<IO::Socket::IP> 0.25 or later is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use it instead
    of L<IO::Socket::INET> for transparent support for both IPv4 and IPv6.
    
    Cookie support requires L<HTTP::CookieJar> or an equivalent class.
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =head2 new
    
        $http = HTTP::Tiny->new( %attributes );
    
    This constructor returns a new HTTP::Tiny object.  Valid attributes include:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    C<agent> — A user-agent string (defaults to 'HTTP-Tiny/$VERSION'). If C<agent> — ends in a space character, the default user-agent string is appended.
    
    =item *
    
    C<cookie_jar> — An instance of L<HTTP::CookieJar> — or equivalent class that supports the C<add> and C<cookie_header> methods
    
    =item *
    
    C<default_headers> — A hashref of default headers to apply to requests
    
    =item *
    
    C<local_address> — The local IP address to bind to
    
    =item *
    
    C<keep_alive> — Whether to reuse the last connection (if for the same scheme, host and port) (defaults to 1)
    
    =item *
    
    C<max_redirect> — Maximum number of redirects allowed (defaults to 5)
    
    =item *
    
    C<max_size> — Maximum response size in bytes (only when not using a data callback).  If defined, responses larger than this will return an exception.
    
    =item *
    
    C<http_proxy> — URL of a proxy server to use for HTTP connections (default is C<$ENV{http_proxy}> — if set)
    
    =item *
    
    C<https_proxy> — URL of a proxy server to use for HTTPS connections (default is C<$ENV{https_proxy}> — if set)
    
    =item *
    
    C<proxy> — URL of a generic proxy server for both HTTP and HTTPS connections (default is C<$ENV{all_proxy}> — if set)
    
    =item *
    
    C<no_proxy> — List of domain suffixes that should not be proxied.  Must be a comma-separated string or an array reference. (default is C<$ENV{no_proxy}> —)
    
    =item *
    
    C<timeout> — Request timeout in seconds (default is 60)
    
    =item *
    
    C<verify_SSL> — A boolean that indicates whether to validate the SSL certificate of an C<https> — connection (default is false)
    
    =item *
    
    C<SSL_options> — A hashref of C<SSL_*> — options to pass through to L<IO::Socket::SSL>
    
    =back
    
    Passing an explicit C<undef> for C<proxy>, C<http_proxy> or C<https_proxy> will
    prevent getting the corresponding proxies from the environment.
    
    Exceptions from C<max_size>, C<timeout> or other errors will result in a
    pseudo-HTTP status code of 599 and a reason of "Internal Exception". The
    content field in the response will contain the text of the exception.
    
    The C<keep_alive> parameter enables a persistent connection, but only to a
    single destination scheme, host and port.  Also, if any connection-relevant
    attributes are modified, or if the process ID or thread ID change, the
    persistent connection will be dropped.  If you want persistent connections
    across multiple destinations, use multiple HTTP::Tiny objects.
    
    See L</SSL SUPPORT> for more on the C<verify_SSL> and C<SSL_options> attributes.

        $response = $http->head($url);
    
    These methods are shorthand for calling C<request()> for the given method.  The
    URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international domain names encoded.
    See C<request()> for valid options and a description of the response.
    
    The C<success> field of the response will be true if the status code is 2XX.
    
    =head2 post_form
    
        $response = $http->post_form($url, $form_data);
        $response = $http->post_form($url, $form_data, \%options);
    
    This method executes a C<POST> request and sends the key/value pairs from a
    form data hash or array reference to the given URL with a C<content-type> of
    C<application/x-www-form-urlencoded>.  If data is provided as an array
    reference, the order is preserved; if provided as a hash reference, the terms
    are sorted on key and value for consistency.  See documentation for the
    C<www_form_urlencode> method for details on the encoding.
    
    The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international domain names
    encoded.  See C<request()> for valid options and a description of the response.
    Any C<content-type> header or content in the options hashref will be ignored.
    
    The C<success> field of the response will be true if the status code is 2XX.
    
    =head2 mirror
    
        $response = $http->mirror($url, $file, \%options)
        if ( $response->{success} ) {
            print "$file is up to date\n";
        }
    
    Executes a C<GET> request for the URL and saves the response body to the file
    name provided.  The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and international
    domain names encoded.  If the file already exists, the request will include an
    C<If-Modified-Since> header with the modification timestamp of the file.  You
    may specify a different C<If-Modified-Since> header yourself in the C<<
    $options->{headers} >> hash.
    
    The C<success> field of the response will be true if the status code is 2XX
    or if the status code is 304 (unmodified).
    
    If the file was modified and the server response includes a properly
    formatted C<Last-Modified> header, the file modification time will
    be updated accordingly.
    
    =head2 request
    
        $response = $http->request($method, $url);
        $response = $http->request($method, $url, \%options);
    
    Executes an HTTP request of the given method type ('GET', 'HEAD', 'POST',
    'PUT', etc.) on the given URL.  The URL must have unsafe characters escaped and
    international domain names encoded.
    
    If the URL includes a "user:password" stanza, they will be used for Basic-style
    authorization headers.  (Authorization headers will not be included in a
    redirected request.) For example:
    
        $http->request('GET', 'http://Aladdin:open sesame@example.com/');
    
    If the "user:password" stanza contains reserved characters, they must
    be percent-escaped:
    
        $http->request('GET', 'http://john%40example.com:password@example.com/');
    
    A hashref of options may be appended to modify the request.
    
    Valid options are:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    C<headers> — A hashref containing headers to include with the request.  If the value for a header is an array reference, the header will be output multiple times with each value in the array.  These headers over-write any default headers.
    
    =item *
    
    C<content> — A scalar to include as the body of the request OR a code reference that will be called iteratively to produce the body of the request
    
    =item *
    
    C<trailer_callback> — A code reference that will be called if it exists to provide a hashref of trailing headers (only used with chunked transfer-encoding)
    
    =item *
    
    C<data_callback> — A code reference that will be called for each chunks of the response body received.
    
    =back
    
    The C<Host> header is generated from the URL in accordance with RFC 2616.  It
    is a fatal error to specify C<Host> in the C<headers> option.  Other headers
    may be ignored or overwritten if necessary for transport compliance.
    
    If the C<content> option is a code reference, it will be called iteratively
    to provide the content body of the request.  It should return the empty
    string or undef when the iterator is exhausted.
    
    If the C<content> option is the empty string, no C<content-type> or
    C<content-length> headers will be generated.
    
    If the C<data_callback> option is provided, it will be called iteratively until
    the entire response body is received.  The first argument will be a string
    containing a chunk of the response body, the second argument will be the
    in-progress response hash reference, as described below.  (This allows
    customizing the action of the callback based on the C<status> or C<headers>
    received prior to the content body.)
    
    The C<request> method returns a hashref containing the response.  The hashref
    will have the following keys:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    C<success> — Boolean indicating whether the operation returned a 2XX status code
    
    =item *
    
    C<url> — URL that provided the response. This is the URL of the request unless there were redirections, in which case it is the last URL queried in a redirection chain
    
    =item *
    
    C<status> — The HTTP status code of the response
    
    =item *
    
    C<reason> — The response phrase returned by the server
    
    =item *
    
    C<content> — The body of the response.  If the response does not have any content or if a data callback is provided to consume the response body, this will be the empty string
    
    =item *
    
    C<headers> — A hashref of header fields.  All header field names will be normalized to be lower case. If a header is repeated, the value will be an arrayref; it will otherwise be a scalar string containing the value
    
    =back
    
    On an exception during the execution of the request, the C<status> field will
    contain 599, and the C<content> field will contain the text of the exception.
    
    =head2 www_form_urlencode
    
        $params = $http->www_form_urlencode( $data );
        $response = $http->get("http://example.com/query?$params");
    
    This method converts the key/value pairs from a data hash or array reference
    into a C<x-www-form-urlencoded> string.  The keys and values from the data
    reference will be UTF-8 encoded and escaped per RFC 3986.  If a value is an
    array reference, the key will be repeated with each of the values of the array
    reference.  If data is provided as a hash reference, the key/value pairs in the
    resulting string will be sorted by key and value for consistent ordering.
    
    =head2 can_ssl
    
        $ok         = HTTP::Tiny->can_ssl;
        ($ok, $why) = HTTP::Tiny->can_ssl;
        ($ok, $why) = $http->can_ssl;
    
    Indicates if SSL support is available.  When called as a class object, it
    checks for the correct version of L<Net::SSLeay> and L<IO::Socket::SSL>.
    When called as an object methods, if C<SSL_verify> is true or if C<SSL_verify_mode>
    is set in C<SSL_options>, it checks that a CA file is available.
    
    In scalar context, returns a boolean indicating if SSL is available.
    In list context, returns the boolean and a (possibly multi-line) string of
    errors indicating why SSL isn't available.

    =head1 SSL SUPPORT
    
    Direct C<https> connections are supported only if L<IO::Socket::SSL> 1.56 or
    greater and L<Net::SSLeay> 1.49 or greater are installed. An exception will be
    thrown if new enough versions of these modules are not installed or if the SSL
    encryption fails. You can also use C<HTTP::Tiny::can_ssl()> utility function
    that returns boolean to see if the required modules are installed.
    
    An C<https> connection may be made via an C<http> proxy that supports the CONNECT
    command (i.e. RFC 2817).  You may not proxy C<https> via a proxy that itself
    requires C<https> to communicate.
    
    SSL provides two distinct capabilities:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    Encrypted communication channel
    
    =item *
    
    Verification of server identity
    
    =back
    
    B<By default, HTTP::Tiny does not verify server identity>.
    
    Server identity verification is controversial and potentially tricky because it
    depends on a (usually paid) third-party Certificate Authority (CA) trust model
    to validate a certificate as legitimate.  This discriminates against servers
    with self-signed certificates or certificates signed by free, community-driven
    CA's such as L<CAcert.org|http://cacert.org>.
    
    By default, HTTP::Tiny does not make any assumptions about your trust model,
    threat level or risk tolerance.  It just aims to give you an encrypted channel
    when you need one.
    
    Setting the C<verify_SSL> attribute to a true value will make HTTP::Tiny verify
    that an SSL connection has a valid SSL certificate corresponding to the host
    name of the connection and that the SSL certificate has been verified by a CA.
    Assuming you trust the CA, this will protect against a L<man-in-the-middle
    attack|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack>.  If you are
    concerned about security, you should enable this option.
    
    Certificate verification requires a file containing trusted CA certificates.
    If the L<Mozilla::CA> module is installed, HTTP::Tiny will use the CA file
    included with it as a source of trusted CA's.  (This means you trust Mozilla,
    the author of Mozilla::CA, the CPAN mirror where you got Mozilla::CA, the
    toolchain used to install it, and your operating system security, right?)
    
    If that module is not available, then HTTP::Tiny will search several
    system-specific default locations for a CA certificate file:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
    
    =item *
    
    /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
    
    =item *
    
    /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem
    
    =back
    
    An exception will be raised if C<verify_SSL> is true and no CA certificate file
    is available.
    
    If you desire complete control over SSL connections, the C<SSL_options> attribute
    lets you provide a hash reference that will be passed through to
    C<IO::Socket::SSL::start_SSL()>, overriding any options set by HTTP::Tiny. For
    example, to provide your own trusted CA file:
    
        SSL_options => {
            SSL_ca_file => $file_path,
        }
    
    The C<SSL_options> attribute could also be used for such things as providing a
    client certificate for authentication to a server or controlling the choice of
    cipher used for the SSL connection. See L<IO::Socket::SSL> documentation for
    details.
    
    =head1 PROXY SUPPORT
    
    HTTP::Tiny can proxy both C<http> and C<https> requests.  Only Basic proxy
    authorization is supported and it must be provided as part of the proxy URL:
    C<http://user:pass@proxy.example.com/>.
    
    HTTP::Tiny supports the following proxy environment variables:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY
    
    =item *
    
    https_proxy or HTTPS_PROXY
    
    =item *
    
    all_proxy or ALL_PROXY
    
    =back
    
    If the C<REQUEST_METHOD> environment variable is set, then this might be a CGI
    process and C<HTTP_PROXY> would be set from the C<Proxy:> header, which is a
    security risk.  If C<REQUEST_METHOD> is set, C<HTTP_PROXY> (the upper case
    variant only) is ignored.
    
    Tunnelling C<https> over an C<http> proxy using the CONNECT method is
    supported.  If your proxy uses C<https> itself, you can not tunnel C<https>
    over it.
    
    Be warned that proxying an C<https> connection opens you to the risk of a
    man-in-the-middle attack by the proxy server.
    
    The C<no_proxy> environment variable is supported in the format of a
    comma-separated list of domain extensions proxy should not be used for.
    
    Proxy arguments passed to C<new> will override their corresponding
    environment variables.
    
    =head1 LIMITATIONS
    
    HTTP::Tiny is I<conditionally compliant> with the
    L<HTTP/1.1 specifications|http://www.w3.org/Protocols/>:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item *
    
    "Message Syntax and Routing" [RFC7230]
    
    =item *
    
    "Semantics and Content" [RFC7231]
    
    =item *
    
    "Conditional Requests" [RFC7232]
    
    =item *
    
    "Range Requests" [RFC7233]
    
    =item *
    
    "Caching" [RFC7234]
    
    =item *
    
    "Authentication" [RFC7235]
    
    =back
    
    It attempts to meet all "MUST" requirements of the specification, but does not
    implement all "SHOULD" requirements.  (Note: it was developed against the
    earlier RFC 2616 specification and may not yet meet the revised RFC 7230-7235
    spec.)
    
    Some particular limitations of note include:
    
    =over
    
    =item *
    
    HTTP::Tiny focuses on correct transport.  Users are responsible for ensuring
    that user-defined headers and content are compliant with the HTTP/1.1
    specification.
    
    =item *
    
    Users must ensure that URLs are properly escaped for unsafe characters and that
    international domain names are properly encoded to ASCII. See L<URI::Escape>,
    L<URI::_punycode> and L<Net::IDN::Encode>.
    
    =item *
    
    Redirection is very strict against the specification.  Redirection is only
    automatic for response codes 301, 302, 307 and 308 if the request method is
    'GET' or 'HEAD'.  Response code 303 is always converted into a 'GET'
    redirection, as mandated by the specification.  There is no automatic support
    for status 305 ("Use proxy") redirections.
    
    =item *
    
    There is no provision for delaying a request body using an C<Expect> header.
    Unexpected C<1XX> responses are silently ignored as per the specification.
    
    =item *
    
    Only 'chunked' C<Transfer-Encoding> is supported.
    
    =item *
    
    There is no support for a Request-URI of '*' for the 'OPTIONS' request.
    
    =back
    
    Despite the limitations listed above, HTTP::Tiny is considered
    feature-complete.  New feature requests should be directed to
    L<HTTP::Tiny::UA>.

     # Note that JSON version 2.0 and above will automatically use
     # JSON::XS or JSON::PP, so you should be able to just:
     
     use JSON;
    
    
    =head1 VERSION
    
        2.27300
    
    L<JSON::XS> 2.27 (~2.30) compatible.
    
    =head1 NOTE
    
    JSON::PP had been inculded in JSON distribution (CPAN module).
    It was a perl core module in Perl 5.14.
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This module is L<JSON::XS> compatible pure Perl module.
    (Perl 5.8 or later is recommended)
    
    JSON::XS is the fastest and most proper JSON module on CPAN.
    It is written by Marc Lehmann in C, so must be compiled and
    installed in the used environment.
    
    JSON::PP is a pure-Perl module and has compatibility to JSON::XS.
    
    
    =head2 FEATURES
    
    =over
    
    =item * correct unicode handling
    
    This module knows how to handle Unicode (depending on Perl version).
    
    See to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL> and L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
    
    
    =item * round-trip integrity
    
    When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types supported
    by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is identical on the Perl
    level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly become "2" just because
    it looks like a number). There I<are> minor exceptions to this, read the
    MAPPING section below to learn about those.
    
    
    =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
    
    There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
    and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a security feature).
    But when some options are set, loose chcking features are available.
    
    =back
    
    =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
    
    Some documents are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE>.
    
    =head2 encode_json
    
        $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
    
    Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string.
    
    This function call is functionally identical to:
    
        $json_text = JSON::PP->new->utf8->encode($perl_scalar)
    
    =head2 decode_json
    
        $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
    
    The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
    to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
    reference.
    
    This function call is functionally identical to:
    
        $perl_scalar = JSON::PP->new->utf8->decode($json_text)
    
    =head2 JSON::PP::is_bool
    
        $is_boolean = JSON::PP::is_bool($scalar)
    
    Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::PP::true or
    JSON::PP::false, two constants that act like C<1> and C<0> respectively
    and are also used to represent JSON C<true> and C<false> in Perl strings.
    
    =head2 JSON::PP::true
    
    Returns JSON true value which is blessed object.
    It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
    
    =head2 JSON::PP::false
    
    Returns JSON false value which is blessed object.
    It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
    
    =head2 JSON::PP::null
    
    Returns C<undef>.
    
    See L<MAPPING>, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to
    Perl.
    
    
    =head1 HOW DO I DECODE A DATA FROM OUTER AND ENCODE TO OUTER
    
    This section supposes that your perl vresion is 5.8 or later.
    
    If you know a JSON text from an outer world - a network, a file content, and so on,
    is encoded in UTF-8, you should use C<decode_json> or C<JSON> module object
    with C<utf8> enable. And the decoded result will contain UNICODE characters.
    
      # from network
      my $json        = JSON::PP->new->utf8;
      my $json_text   = CGI->new->param( 'json_data' );
      my $perl_scalar = $json->decode( $json_text );
      
      # from file content
      local $/;
      open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
      $json_text   = <$fh>;
      $perl_scalar = decode_json( $json_text );
    
    If an outer data is not encoded in UTF-8, firstly you should C<decode> it.
    
      use Encode;
      local $/;
      open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
      my $encoding = 'cp932';
      my $unicode_json_text = decode( $encoding, <$fh> ); # UNICODE
      
      # or you can write the below code.
      #
      # open( my $fh, "<:encoding($encoding)", 'json.data' );
      # $unicode_json_text = <$fh>;
    
    In this case, C<$unicode_json_text> is of course UNICODE string.
    So you B<cannot> use C<decode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
    Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
    
      $perl_scalar = $json->utf8(0)->decode( $unicode_json_text );
    
    Or C<encode 'utf8'> and C<decode_json>:
    
      $perl_scalar = decode_json( encode( 'utf8', $unicode_json_text ) );
      # this way is not efficient.
    
    And now, you want to convert your C<$perl_scalar> into JSON data and
    send it to an outer world - a network or a file content, and so on.
    
    Your data usually contains UNICODE strings and you want the converted data to be encoded
    in UTF-8, you should use C<encode_json> or C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
    
      print encode_json( $perl_scalar ); # to a network? file? or display?
      # or
      print $json->utf8->encode( $perl_scalar );
    
    If C<$perl_scalar> does not contain UNICODE but C<$encoding>-encoded strings
    for some reason, then its characters are regarded as B<latin1> for perl
    (because it does not concern with your $encoding).
    You B<cannot> use C<encode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
    Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
    Note that the resulted text is a UNICODE string but no problem to print it.
    
      # $perl_scalar contains $encoding encoded string values
      $unicode_json_text = $json->utf8(0)->encode( $perl_scalar );
      # $unicode_json_text consists of characters less than 0x100
      print $unicode_json_text;
    
    Or C<decode $encoding> all string values and C<encode_json>:
    
      $perl_scalar->{ foo } = decode( $encoding, $perl_scalar->{ foo } );
      # ... do it to each string values, then encode_json
      $json_text = encode_json( $perl_scalar );
    
    This method is a proper way but probably not efficient.
    
    See to L<Encode>, L<perluniintro>.
    
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    Basically, check to L<JSON> or L<JSON::XS>.
    
    =head2 new
    
        $json = JSON::PP->new
    
    Rturns a new JSON::PP object that can be used to de/encode JSON
    strings.
    
    All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
    
    The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
    be chained:
    
       my $json = JSON::PP->new->utf8->space_after->encode({a => [1,2]})
       => {"a": [1, 2]}
    
    =head2 ascii
    
        $json = $json->ascii([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_ascii
    
    If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will not generate characters outside
    the code range 0..127. Any Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either
    a single \uXXXX or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence, as per RFC4627.
    (See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>).
    
    In Perl 5.005, there is no character having high value (more than 255).
    See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
    
    If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters unless
    required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results in a faster and more compact format.
    
      JSON::PP->new->ascii(1)->encode([chr 0x10401])
      => ["\ud801\udc01"]
    
    =head2 latin1
    
        $json = $json->latin1([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_latin1
    
    If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the resulting JSON
    text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters outside the code range 0..255.
    
    If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters
    unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
    
      JSON::XS->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
      => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
    
    See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
    
    =head2 utf8
    
        $json = $json->utf8([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_utf8
    
    If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the JSON result
    into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the decode method expects to be handled
    an UTF-8-encoded string. Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any
    characters outside the range 0..255, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O.
    
    (In Perl 5.005, any character outside the range 0..255 does not exist.
    See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.)
    
    In future versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16 and UTF-32
    encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
    
    If $enable is false, then the encode method will return the JSON string as a (non-encoded)
    Unicode string, while decode expects thus a Unicode string. Any decoding or encoding
    (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
    
    Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
    
      use Encode;
      $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::PP->new->encode ($object);
    
    Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
    
      use Encode;
      $object = JSON::PP->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
    
    
    =head2 pretty
    
        $json = $json->pretty([$enable])
    
    This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
    C<space_after> flags in one call to generate the most readable
    (or most compact) form possible.
    
    Equivalent to:
    
       $json->indent->space_before->space_after
    
    =head2 indent
    
        $json = $json->indent([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_indent
    
    The default indent space length is three.
    You can use C<indent_length> to change the length.
    
    =head2 space_before
    
        $json = $json->space_before([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_space_before
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
    optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
    
    If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
    space at those places.
    
    This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
    
    Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
    
       {"key" :"value"}
    
    =head2 space_after
    
        $json = $json->space_after([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_space_after
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
    optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
    and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
    members.
    
    If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
    space at those places.
    
    This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
    
    Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
    
       {"key": "value"}
    
    =head2 relaxed
    
        $json = $json->relaxed([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
    extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
    affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
    JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
    parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
    resource files etc.)
    
    If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
    valid JSON texts.
    
    Currently accepted extensions are:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item * list items can have an end-comma
    
    JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
    can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
    quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
    such items not just between them:
    
       [
          1,
          2, <- this comma not normally allowed
       ]
       {
          "k1": "v1",
          "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
       }
    
    =item * shell-style '#'-comments
    
    Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
    allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
    character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
    
      [
         1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
            # neither this one...
      ]
    
    =back
    
    =head2 canonical
    
        $json = $json->canonical([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_canonical
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
    by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
    
    If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
    pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
    of the same script).
    
    This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
    the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
    the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
    as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
    
    This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
    
    If you want your own sorting routine, you can give a code referece
    or a subroutine name to C<sort_by>. See to C<JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
    
    =head2 allow_nonref
    
        $json = $json->allow_nonref([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
    non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
    which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
    values instead of croaking.
    
    If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
    passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
    or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
    JSON object or array.
    
       JSON::PP->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
       => "Hello, World!"
    
    =head2 allow_unknown
    
        $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
    
    If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode" will *not* throw an
    exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
    example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON "null" value.
    Note that blessed objects are not included here and are handled
    separately by c<allow_nonref>.
    
    If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an
    exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
    
    This option does not affect "decode" in any way, and it is
    recommended to leave it off unless you know your communications
    partner.
    
    =head2 allow_blessed
    
        $json = $json->allow_blessed([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
    barf when it encounters a blessed reference. Instead, the value of the
    B<convert_blessed> option will decide whether C<null> (C<convert_blessed>
    disabled or no C<TO_JSON> method found) or a representation of the
    object (C<convert_blessed> enabled and C<TO_JSON> method found) is being
    encoded. Has no effect on C<decode>.
    
    If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
    exception when it encounters a blessed object.
    
    =head2 convert_blessed
    
        $json = $json->convert_blessed([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
    blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
    on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context
    and the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object. If no
    C<TO_JSON> method is found, the value of C<allow_blessed> will decide what
    to do.
    
    The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
    returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
    way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
    (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
    methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
    usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with the C<to_json>
    function or method.
    
    This setting does not yet influence C<decode> in any way.
    
    If C<$enable> is false, then the C<allow_blessed> setting will decide what
    to do when a blessed object is found.
    
    =head2 filter_json_object
    
        $json = $json->filter_json_object([$coderef])
    
    When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
    time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument passed to the coderef
    is a reference to the newly-created hash. If the code references returns
    a single scalar (which need not be a reference), this value
    (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid aliasing) is inserted into the
    deserialised data structure. If it returns an empty list
    (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the original deserialised
    hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down decoding considerably.
    
    When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
    be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
    way.
    
    Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
    
       my $js = JSON::PP->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
       # returns [5]
       $js->decode ('[{}]'); # the given subroutine takes a hash reference.
       # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
       # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
       $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
    
    =head2 filter_json_single_key_object
    
        $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object($key [=> $coderef])
    
    Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
    JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
    
    This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
    C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
    object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
    structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
    the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
    single-key callback were specified.
    
    If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
    disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
    
    As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
    one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
    objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
    as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
    as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
    support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
    like a serialised Perl hash.
    
    Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
    C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
    things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
    with real hashes.
    
    Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
    into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
    
       # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
       JSON::PP
          ->new
          ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
                $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
             })
          ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
    
       # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
       # for serialisation to json:
       sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
          my ($self) = @_;
    
          unless ($self->{id}) {
             $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
             $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
          }
    
          { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
       }
    
    =head2 shrink
    
        $json = $json->shrink([$enable])
        
        $enabled = $json->get_shrink
    
    In JSON::XS, this flag resizes strings generated by either
    C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible.
    It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form if possible.
    
    In JSON::PP, it is noop about resizing strings but tries
    C<utf8::downgrade> to the returned string by C<encode>.
    See to L<utf8>.
    
    See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>
    
    =head2 max_depth
    
        $json = $json->max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])
        
        $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
    
    Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
    or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
    data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
    point.
    
    Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
    needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
    characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
    given character in a string.
    
    If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
    is rarely useful.
    
    See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
    
    When a large value (100 or more) was set and it de/encodes a deep nested object/text,
    it may raise a warning 'Deep recursion on subroutin' at the perl runtime phase.
    
    =head2 max_size
    
        $json = $json->max_size([$maximum_string_size])
        
        $max_size = $json->get_max_size
    
    Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
    being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
    is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
    attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
    effect on C<encode> (yet).
    
    If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
    C<0> is specified).
    
    See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
    
    =head2 encode
    
        $json_text = $json->encode($perl_scalar)
    
    Converts the given Perl data structure (a simple scalar or a reference
    to a hash or array) to its JSON representation. Simple scalars will be
    converted into JSON string or number sequences, while references to arrays
    become JSON arrays and references to hashes become JSON objects. Undefined
    Perl values (e.g. C<undef>) become JSON C<null> values.
    References to the integers C<0> and C<1> are converted into C<true> and C<false>.
    
    =head2 decode
    
        $perl_scalar = $json->decode($json_text)
    
    The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
    returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
    
    JSON numbers and strings become simple Perl scalars. JSON arrays become
    Perl arrayrefs and JSON objects become Perl hashrefs. C<true> becomes
    C<1> (C<JSON::true>), C<false> becomes C<0> (C<JSON::false>) and
    C<null> becomes C<undef>.
    
    =head2 decode_prefix
    
        ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix($json_text)
    
    This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
    when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
    silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
    so far.
    
       JSON->new->decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
       => ([], 3)
    
    =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
    
    Most of this section are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING>.
    
    In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON texts.
    This module does allow you to parse a JSON stream incrementally.
    It does so by accumulating text until it has a full JSON object, which
    it then can decode. This process is similar to using C<decode_prefix>
    to see if a full JSON object is available, but is much more efficient
    (and can be implemented with a minimum of method calls).
    
    This module will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
    has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
    truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
    early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect parenthese
    mismatches. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
    soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
    to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
    parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
    
    The following methods implement this incremental parser.
    
    =head2 incr_parse
    
        $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
        
        $obj_or_undef = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
        
        @obj_or_empty = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
    
    This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
    extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
    functions are optional).
    
    If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
    existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
    
    After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
    return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
    in as many chunks as you want.
    
    If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
    exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
    object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
    this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
    C<incr_skip> to skip the errornous part). This is the most common way of
    using the method.
    
    And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
    from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
    otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
    objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
    an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
    case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
    lost.
    
    Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return them.
    
        my @objs = JSON->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
    
    =head2 incr_text
    
        $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
    
    This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
    is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
    C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
    all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
    although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
    real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
    method before having parsed anything.
    
    This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
    JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
    (such as commas).
    
        $json->incr_text =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
    
    In Perl 5.005, C<lvalue> attribute is not available.
    You must write codes like the below:
    
        $string = $json->incr_text;
        $string =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
        $json->incr_text( $string );
    
    =head2 incr_skip
    
        $json->incr_skip
    
    This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove the
    parsed text from the input buffer. This is useful after C<incr_parse>
    died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser state is left
    unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the parse state.
    
    =head2 incr_reset
    
        $json->incr_reset
    
    This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
    it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
    
    This is useful if you want ot repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
    ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
    each successful decode.
    
    See to L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING> for examples.
    
    
    =head1 JSON::PP OWN METHODS
    
    =head2 allow_singlequote
    
        $json = $json->allow_singlequote([$enable])
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
    JSON strings quoted by single quotations that are invalid JSON
    format.
    
        $json->allow_singlequote->decode({"foo":'bar'});
        $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':"bar"});
        $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':'bar'});
    
    As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
    application-specific files written by humans.
    
    
    =head2 allow_barekey
    
        $json = $json->allow_barekey([$enable])
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
    bare keys of JSON object that are invalid JSON format.
    
    As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
    application-specific files written by humans.
    
        $json->allow_barekey->decode('{foo:"bar"}');
    
    =head2 allow_bignum
    
        $json = $json->allow_bignum([$enable])
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will convert
    the big integer Perl cannot handle as integer into a L<Math::BigInt>
    object and convert a floating number (any) into a L<Math::BigFloat>.
    
    On the contary, C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
    objects into JSON numbers with C<allow_blessed> enable.
    
       $json->allow_nonref->allow_blessed->allow_bignum;
       $bigfloat = $json->decode('2.000000000000000000000000001');
       print $json->encode($bigfloat);
       # => 2.000000000000000000000000001
    
    See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING> aboout the normal conversion of JSON number.
    
    =head2 loose
    
        $json = $json->loose([$enable])
    
    The unescaped [\x00-\x1f\x22\x2f\x5c] strings are invalid in JSON strings
    and the module doesn't allow to C<decode> to these (except for \x2f).
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode>  will accept these
    unescaped strings.
    
        $json->loose->decode(qq|["abc
                                       def"]|);
    
    See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS>.
    
    =head2 escape_slash
    
        $json = $json->escape_slash([$enable])
    
    According to JSON Grammar, I<slash> (U+002F) is escaped. But default
    JSON::PP (as same as JSON::XS) encodes strings without escaping slash.
    
    If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will escape slashes.
    
    =head2 indent_length
    
        $json = $json->indent_length($length)
    
    JSON::XS indent space length is 3 and cannot be changed.
    JSON::PP set the indent space length with the given $length.
    The default is 3. The acceptable range is 0 to 15.
    
    =head2 sort_by
    
        $json = $json->sort_by($function_name)
        $json = $json->sort_by($subroutine_ref)
    
    If $function_name or $subroutine_ref are set, its sort routine are used
    in encoding JSON objects.
    
       $js = $pc->sort_by(sub { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b })->encode($obj);
       # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
    
       $js = $pc->sort_by('own_sort')->encode($obj);
       # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
    
       sub JSON::PP::own_sort { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b }
    
    As the sorting routine runs in the JSON::PP scope, the given
    subroutine name and the special variables C<$a>, C<$b> will begin
    'JSON::PP::'.
    
    If $integer is set, then the effect is same as C<canonical> on.

    =head1 MAPPING
    
    This section is copied from JSON::XS and modified to C<JSON::PP>.
    JSON::XS and JSON::PP mapping mechanisms are almost equivalent.
    
    See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING>.
    
    =head2 JSON -> PERL
    
    =over 4
    
    =item object
    
    A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
    keys is preserved (JSON does not preserver object key ordering itself).
    
    =item array
    
    A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
    
    =item string
    
    A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
    are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
    decoding is necessary.
    
    =item number
    
    A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
    string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
    the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
    the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
    might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
    
    If the number consists of digits only, C<JSON> will try to represent
    it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
    a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
    precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
    which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
    re-encoded toa JSON string).
    
    Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
    represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
    precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
    the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
    
    Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
    represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
    floating point, C<JSON> only guarantees precision up to but not including
    the leats significant bit.
    
    When C<allow_bignum> is enable, the big integers 
    and the numeric can be optionally converted into L<Math::BigInt> and
    L<Math::BigFloat> objects.
    
    =item true, false
    
    These JSON atoms become C<JSON::PP::true> and C<JSON::PP::false>,
    respectively. They are overloaded to act almost exactly like the numbers
    C<1> and C<0>. You can check wether a scalar is a JSON boolean by using
    the C<JSON::is_bool> function.
    
       print JSON::PP::true . "\n";
        => true
       print JSON::PP::true + 1;
        => 1
    
       ok(JSON::true eq  '1');
       ok(JSON::true == 1);
    
    C<JSON> will install these missing overloading features to the backend modules.
    
    
    =item null
    
    A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
    
    C<JSON::PP::null> returns C<unddef>.
    
    =back
    
    
    =head2 PERL -> JSON
    
    The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
    truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
    a Perl value.
    
    =over 4
    
    =item hash references
    
    Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent ordering
    in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded in a
    pseudo-random order that can change between runs of the same program but
    stays generally the same within a single run of a program. C<JSON>
    optionally sort the hash keys (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so
    the same datastructure will serialise to the same JSON text (given same
    settings and version of JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead
    and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text
    against another for equality.
    
    
    =item array references
    
    Perl array references become JSON arrays.
    
    =item other references
    
    Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
    exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
    C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON. You can
    also use C<JSON::false> and C<JSON::true> to improve readability.
    
       to_json [\0,JSON::PP::true]      # yields [false,true]
    
    =item JSON::PP::true, JSON::PP::false, JSON::PP::null
    
    These special values become JSON true and JSON false values,
    respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0> directly if you want.
    
    JSON::PP::null returns C<undef>.
    
    =item blessed objects
    
    Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON. See the
    C<allow_blessed> and C<convert_blessed> methods on various options on
    how to deal with this: basically, you can choose between throwing an
    exception, encoding the reference as if it weren't blessed, or provide
    your own serialiser method.
    
    See to L<convert_blessed>.
    
    =item simple scalars
    
    Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
    difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS and JSON::PP will encode undefined scalars as
    JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
    before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
    
       # dump as number
       encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
       encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
       my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
    
       # used as string, so dump as string
       print $value;
       encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
    
       # undef becomes null
       encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
    
    You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:
    
       my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
       "$x";        # stringified
       $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
       print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
    
    You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:
    
       my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
       $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
       $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choise is yours.
    
    You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways.
    
    Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
    binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
    can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
    extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
    infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
    error to pass those in.
    
    =item Big Number
    
    When C<allow_bignum> is enable, 
    C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
    objects into JSON numbers.
    
    
    =back
    
    =head1 UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS
    
    If you do not know about Unicode on Perl well,
    please check L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>.
    
    =head2 Perl 5.8 and later
    
    Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work properly.
    
        $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);
        $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345);
    
    Reuturns C<"\u3042"> and C<"\ud808\udf45"> respectively.
    
        $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\u3042"');
        $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
    
    Returns UTF-8 encoded strings with UTF8 flag, regarded as C<U+3042> and C<U+12345>.
    
    Note that the versions from Perl 5.8.0 to 5.8.2, Perl built-in C<join> was broken,
    so JSON::PP wraps the C<join> with a subroutine. Thus JSON::PP works slow in the versions.
    
    
    =head2 Perl 5.6
    
    Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work.
    
    =head2 Perl 5.005
    
    Perl 5.005 is a byte sementics world -- all strings are sequences of bytes.
    That means the unicode handling is not available.
    
    In encoding,
    
        $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);  # hex 3042 is 12354.
        $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345); # hex 12345 is 74565.
    
    Returns C<B> and C<E>, as C<chr> takes a value more than 255, it treats
    as C<$value % 256>, so the above codes are equivalent to :
    
        $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 66);
        $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 69);
    
    In decoding,
    
        $json->decode('"\u00e3\u0081\u0082"');
    
    The returned is a byte sequence C<0xE3 0x81 0x82> for UTF-8 encoded
    japanese character (C<HIRAGANA LETTER A>).
    And if it is represented in Unicode code point, C<U+3042>.
    
    Next, 
    
        $json->decode('"\u3042"');
    
    We ordinary expect the returned value is a Unicode character C<U+3042>.
    But here is 5.005 world. This is C<0xE3 0x81 0x82>.
    
        $json->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
    
    This is not a character C<U+12345> but bytes - C<0xf0 0x92 0x8d 0x85>.

    =head1 NAME
    
    Module::CPANfile - Parse cpanfile
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
      use Module::CPANfile;
    
      my $file = Module::CPANfile->load("cpanfile");
      my $prereqs = $file->prereqs; # CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object
    
      my @features = $file->features; # CPAN::Meta::Feature objects
      my $merged_prereqs = $file->prereqs_with(@identifiers); # CPAN::Meta::Prereqs
    
      $file->merge_meta('MYMETA.json');
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    Module::CPANfile is a tool to handle L<cpanfile> format to load application
    specific dependencies, not just for CPAN distributions.
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =over 4
    
    =item load
    
      $file = Module::CPANfile->load;
      $file = Module::CPANfile->load('cpanfile');
    
    Load and parse a cpanfile. By default it tries to load C<cpanfile> in
    the current directory, unless you pass the path to its argument.
    
    =item from_prereqs
    
      $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs({
        runtime => { requires => { DBI => '1.000' } },
      });
    
    Creates a new Module::CPANfile object from prereqs hash you can get
    via L<CPAN::Meta>'s C<prereqs>, or L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs>'
    C<as_string_hash>.
    
      # read MYMETA, then feed the prereqs to create Module::CPANfile
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file('MYMETA.json');
      my $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($meta->prereqs);
    
      # load cpanfile, then recreate it with round-trip
      my $file = Module::CPANfile->load('cpanfile');
      $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($file->prereq_specs);
                                        # or $file->prereqs->as_string_hash
    
    =item prereqs
    
    Returns L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object out of the parsed cpanfile.
    
    =item prereq_specs
    
    Returns a hash reference that should be passed to C<< CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new >>.
    
    =item features
    
    Returns a list of features available in the cpanfile as L<CPAN::Meta::Feature>.
    
    =item prereqs_with(@identifiers), effective_prereqs(\@identifiers)
    
    Returns L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object, with merged prereqs for
    features identified with the C<@identifiers>.
    
    =item to_string($include_empty)
    
      $file->to_string;
      $file->to_string(1);
    
    Returns a canonical string (code) representation for cpanfile. Useful
    if you want to convert L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> to a new cpanfile.
    
      # read MYMETA's prereqs and print cpanfile representation of it
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file('MYMETA.json');
      my $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($meta->prereqs);
      print $file->to_string;
    
    By default, it omits the phase where there're no modules
    registered. If you pass the argument of a true value, it will print
    them as well.
    
    =item save
    
      $file->save('cpanfile');
    
    Saves the currently loaded prereqs as a new C<cpanfile> by calling
    C<to_string>. Beware B<this method will overwrite the existing
    cpanfile without any warning or backup>. Taking a backup or giving
    warnings to users is a caller's responsibility.
    
      # Read MYMETA.json and creates a new cpanfile
      my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file('MYMETA.json');
      my $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($meta->prereqs);
      $file->save('cpanfile');
    
    =item merge_meta
    
      $file->merge_meta('META.yml');
      $file->merge_meta('MYMETA.json', '2.0');
    
    Merge the effective prereqs with Meta specification loaded from the
    given META file, using CPAN::Meta. You can specify the META spec
    version in the second argument, which defaults to 1.4 in case the
    given file is YAML, and 2 if it is JSON.

    =head1 NAME
    
    Module::Metadata - Gather package and POD information from perl module files
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
      use Module::Metadata;
    
      # information about a .pm file
      my $info = Module::Metadata->new_from_file( $file );
      my $version = $info->version;
    
      # CPAN META 'provides' field for .pm files in a directory
      my $provides = Module::Metadata->provides(
        dir => 'lib', version => 2
      );
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This module provides a standard way to gather metadata about a .pm file through
    (mostly) static analysis and (some) code execution.  When determining the
    version of a module, the C<$VERSION> assignment is C<eval>ed, as is traditional
    in the CPAN toolchain.
    
    =head1 CLASS METHODS
    
    =head2 C<< new_from_file($filename, collect_pod => 1) >>
    
    Constructs a C<Module::Metadata> object given the path to a file.  Returns
    undef if the filename does not exist.
    
    C<collect_pod> is a optional boolean argument that determines whether POD
    data is collected and stored for reference.  POD data is not collected by
    default.  POD headings are always collected.
    
    If the file begins by an UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE byte-order mark, then
    it is skipped before processing, and the content of the file is also decoded
    appropriately starting from perl 5.8.
    
    =head2 C<< new_from_handle($handle, $filename, collect_pod => 1) >>
    
    This works just like C<new_from_file>, except that a handle can be provided
    as the first argument.
    
    Note that there is no validation to confirm that the handle is a handle or
    something that can act like one.  Passing something that isn't a handle will
    cause a exception when trying to read from it.  The C<filename> argument is
    mandatory or undef will be returned.
    
    You are responsible for setting the decoding layers on C<$handle> if
    required.
    
    =head2 C<< new_from_module($module, collect_pod => 1, inc => \@dirs) >>
    
    Constructs a C<Module::Metadata> object given a module or package name.
    Returns undef if the module cannot be found.
    
    In addition to accepting the C<collect_pod> argument as described above,
    this method accepts a C<inc> argument which is a reference to an array of
    directories to search for the module.  If none are given, the default is
    @INC.
    
    If the file that contains the module begins by an UTF-8, UTF-16BE or
    UTF-16LE byte-order mark, then it is skipped before processing, and the
    content of the file is also decoded appropriately starting from perl 5.8.
    
    =head2 C<< find_module_by_name($module, \@dirs) >>
    
    Returns the path to a module given the module or package name. A list
    of directories can be passed in as an optional parameter, otherwise
    @INC is searched.
    
    Can be called as either an object or a class method.
    
    =head2 C<< find_module_dir_by_name($module, \@dirs) >>
    
    Returns the entry in C<@dirs> (or C<@INC> by default) that contains
    the module C<$module>. A list of directories can be passed in as an
    optional parameter, otherwise @INC is searched.
    
    Can be called as either an object or a class method.
    
    =head2 C<< provides( %options ) >>
    
    This is a convenience wrapper around C<package_versions_from_directory>
    to generate a CPAN META C<provides> data structure.  It takes key/value
    pairs.  Valid option keys include:
    
    =over
    
    =item version B<(required)>
    
    Specifies which version of the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> should be used as
    the format of the C<provides> output.  Currently only '1.4' and '2'
    are supported (and their format is identical).  This may change in
    the future as the definition of C<provides> changes.
    
    The C<version> option is required.  If it is omitted or if
    an unsupported version is given, then C<provides> will throw an error.
    
    =item dir
    
    Directory to search recursively for F<.pm> files.  May not be specified with
    C<files>.
    
    =item files
    
    Array reference of files to examine.  May not be specified with C<dir>.
    
    =item prefix
    
    String to prepend to the C<file> field of the resulting output. This defaults
    to F<lib>, which is the common case for most CPAN distributions with their
    F<.pm> files in F<lib>.  This option ensures the META information has the
    correct relative path even when the C<dir> or C<files> arguments are
    absolute or have relative paths from a location other than the distribution
    root.
    
    =back
    
    For example, given C<dir> of 'lib' and C<prefix> of 'lib', the return value
    is a hashref of the form:
    
      {
        'Package::Name' => {
          version => '0.123',
          file => 'lib/Package/Name.pm'
        },
        'OtherPackage::Name' => ...
      }
    
    =head2 C<< package_versions_from_directory($dir, \@files?) >>
    
    Scans C<$dir> for .pm files (unless C<@files> is given, in which case looks
    for those files in C<$dir> - and reads each file for packages and versions,
    returning a hashref of the form:
    
      {
        'Package::Name' => {
          version => '0.123',
          file => 'Package/Name.pm'
        },
        'OtherPackage::Name' => ...
      }
    
    The C<DB> and C<main> packages are always omitted, as are any "private"
    packages that have leading underscores in the namespace (e.g.
    C<Foo::_private>)
    
    Note that the file path is relative to C<$dir> if that is specified.
    This B<must not> be used directly for CPAN META C<provides>.  See
    the C<provides> method instead.
    
    =head2 C<< log_info (internal) >>
    
    Used internally to perform logging; imported from Log::Contextual if
    Log::Contextual has already been loaded, otherwise simply calls warn.
    
    =head1 OBJECT METHODS
    
    =head2 C<< name() >>
    
    Returns the name of the package represented by this module. If there
    is more than one package, it makes a best guess based on the
    filename. If it's a script (i.e. not a *.pm) the package name is
    'main'.
    
    =head2 C<< version($package) >>
    
    Returns the version as defined by the $VERSION variable for the
    package as returned by the C<name> method if no arguments are
    given. If given the name of a package it will attempt to return the
    version of that package if it is specified in the file.
    
    =head2 C<< filename() >>
    
    Returns the absolute path to the file.
    Note that this file may not actually exist on disk yet, e.g. if the module was read from an in-memory filehandle.
    
    =head2 C<< packages_inside() >>
    
    Returns a list of packages. Note: this is a raw list of packages
    discovered (or assumed, in the case of C<main>).  It is not
    filtered for C<DB>, C<main> or private packages the way the
    C<provides> method does.  Invalid package names are not returned,
    for example "Foo:Bar".  Strange but valid package names are
    returned, for example "Foo::Bar::", and are left up to the caller
    on how to handle.
    
    =head2 C<< pod_inside() >>
    
    Returns a list of POD sections.
    
    =head2 C<< contains_pod() >>
    
    Returns true if there is any POD in the file.
    
    =head2 C<< pod($section) >>
    
    Returns the POD data in the given section.
    
    =head2 C<< is_indexable($package) >> or C<< is_indexable() >>
    
    Returns a boolean indicating whether the package (if provided) or any package
    (otherwise) is eligible for indexing by PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server.
    Note This only checks for valid C<package> declarations, and does not take any
    ownership information into account.

    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    B<Parse::CPAN::Meta> is a parser for F<META.json> and F<META.yml> files, using
    L<JSON::PP> and/or L<CPAN::Meta::YAML>.
    
    B<Parse::CPAN::Meta> provides three methods: C<load_file>, C<load_json_string>,
    and C<load_yaml_string>.  These will read and deserialize CPAN metafiles, and
    are described below in detail.
    
    B<Parse::CPAN::Meta> provides a legacy API of only two functions,
    based on the YAML functions of the same name. Wherever possible,
    identical calling semantics are used.  These may only be used with YAML sources.
    
    All error reporting is done with exceptions (die'ing).
    
    Note that META files are expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, only.  When
    converted string data, it must first be decoded from UTF-8.

    =end Pod::Coverage
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =head2 load_file
    
      my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_file('META.json');
    
      my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_file('META.yml');
    
    This method will read the named file and deserialize it to a data structure,
    determining whether it should be JSON or YAML based on the filename.
    The file will be read using the ":utf8" IO layer.
    
    =head2 load_yaml_string
    
      my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_yaml_string($yaml_string);
    
    This method deserializes the given string of YAML and returns the first
    document in it.  (CPAN metadata files should always have only one document.)
    If the source was UTF-8 encoded, the string must be decoded before calling
    C<load_yaml_string>.
    
    =head2 load_json_string
    
      my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_json_string($json_string);
    
    This method deserializes the given string of JSON and the result.  
    If the source was UTF-8 encoded, the string must be decoded before calling
    C<load_json_string>.
    
    =head2 load_string
    
      my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_string($some_string);
    
    If you don't know whether a string contains YAML or JSON data, this method
    will use some heuristics and guess.  If it can't tell, it assumes YAML.
    
    =head2 yaml_backend
    
      my $backend = Parse::CPAN::Meta->yaml_backend;
    
    Returns the module name of the YAML serializer. See L</ENVIRONMENT>
    for details.
    
    =head2 json_backend
    
      my $backend = Parse::CPAN::Meta->json_backend;
    
    Returns the module name of the JSON serializer.  This will either
    be L<JSON::PP> or L<JSON>.  Even if C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND> is set,
    this will return L<JSON> as further delegation is handled by
    the L<JSON> module.  See L</ENVIRONMENT> for details.
    
    =head1 FUNCTIONS
    
    For maintenance clarity, no functions are exported by default.  These functions
    are available for backwards compatibility only and are best avoided in favor of
    C<load_file>.
    
    =head2 Load
    
      my @yaml = Parse::CPAN::Meta::Load( $string );
    
    Parses a string containing a valid YAML stream into a list of Perl data
    structures.
    
    =head2 LoadFile
    
      my @yaml = Parse::CPAN::Meta::LoadFile( 'META.yml' );
    
    Reads the YAML stream from a file instead of a string.
    
    =head1 ENVIRONMENT
    
    =head2 PERL_JSON_BACKEND
    
    By default, L<JSON::PP> will be used for deserializing JSON data. If the
    C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND> environment variable exists, is true and is not
    "JSON::PP", then the L<JSON> module (version 2.5 or greater) will be loaded and
    used to interpret C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND>.  If L<JSON> is not installed or is too
    old, an exception will be thrown.
    
    =head2 PERL_YAML_BACKEND
    
    By default, L<CPAN::Meta::YAML> will be used for deserializing YAML data. If
    the C<PERL_YAML_BACKEND> environment variable is defined, then it is interpreted
    as a module to use for deserialization.  The given module must be installed,
    must load correctly and must implement the C<Load()> function or an exception
    will be thrown.

    Parse::PMFile - parses .pm file as PAUSE does
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
        use Parse::PMFile;
    
        my $parser = Parse::PMFile->new($metadata, {VERBOSE => 1});
        my $packages_info = $parser->parse($pmfile);
    
        # if you need info about invalid versions
        my ($packages_info, $errors) = $parser->parse($pmfile);
    
        # to check permissions
        my $parser = Parse::PMFile->new($metadata, {
            USERID => 'ISHIGAKI',
            PERMISSIONS => PAUSE::Permissions->new,
        });
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    The most of the code of this module is taken from the PAUSE code as of April 2013 almost verbatim. Thus, the heart of this module should be quite stable. However, I made it not to use pipe ("-|") as well as I stripped database-related code. If you encounter any issue, that's most probably because of my modification.
    
    This module doesn't provide features to extract a distribution or parse meta files intentionally.
    
    =head1 METHODS
    
    =head2 new
    
    creates an object. You can also pass a hashref taken from META.yml etc, and an optional hashref. Options are:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item ALLOW_DEV_VERSION
    
    Parse::PMFile usually ignores a version with an underscore as PAUSE does (because it's for a developer release, and should not be indexed). Set this option to true if you happen to need to keep such a version for better analysis.
    
    =item VERBOSE
    
    Set this to true if you need to know some details.
    
    =item FORK
    
    As of version 0.17, Parse::PMFile stops forking while parsing a version for better performance. Parse::PMFile should return the same result no matter how this option is set, but if you do care, set this to true to fork as PAUSE does.
    
    =item USERID, PERMISSIONS
    
    As of version 0.21, Parse::PMFile checks permissions of a package if both USERID and PERMISSIONS (which should be an instance of L<PAUSE::Permissions>) are provided. Unauthorized packages are removed.
    
    =item UNSAFE
    
    Parse::PMFile usually parses a module version in a Safe compartment. However, this approach doesn't work smoothly under older perls (prior to 5.10) plus some combinations of recent versions of Safe.pm (2.24 and above) and version.pm (0.9905 and above) for various reasons. As of version 0.27, Parse::PMFile simply uses C<eval> to parse a version under older perls. If you want it to use always C<eval> (even under recent perls), set this to true.

    B<shell_quote> quotes strings so they can be passed through the shell.
    Each I<string> is quoted so that the shell will pass it along as a
    single argument and without further interpretation.  If no I<string>s
    are given an empty string is returned.
    
    If any I<string> can't be safely quoted B<shell_quote> will B<croak>.

    This is like B<shell_quote>, excpet if the string can't be safely quoted
    it does the best it can and returns the result, instead of dying.

    =item B<shell_comment_quote> [I<string>]
    
    B<shell_comment_quote> quotes the I<string> so that it can safely be
    included in a shell-style comment (the current algorithm is that a sharp
    character is placed after any newlines in the string).
    
    This routine might be changed to accept multiple I<string> arguments
    in the future.  I haven't done this yet because I'm not sure if the
    I<string>s should be joined with blanks ($") or nothing ($,).  Cast
    your vote today!  Be sure to justify your answer.

    =head1 BUGS
    
    Only Bourne shell quoting is supported.  I'd like to add other shells
    (particularly cmd.exe), but I'm not familiar with them.  It would be a
    big help if somebody supplied the details.

    =head1 NAME
    
    lib::core::only - Remove all non-core paths from @INC to avoid site/vendor dirs
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
      use lib::core::only; # now @INC contains only the two core directories
    
    To get only the core directories plus the ones for the local::lib in scope:
    
      $ perl -mlocal::lib -Mlib::core::only -Mlocal::lib=~/perl5 myscript.pl
    
    To attempt to do a self-contained build (but note this will not reliably
    propagate into subprocesses, see the CAVEATS below):
    
      $ PERL5OPT='-mlocal::lib -Mlib::core::only -Mlocal::lib=~/perl5' cpan
    
    Please note that it is necessary to use C<local::lib> twice for this to work.
    First so that C<lib::core::only> doesn't prevent C<local::lib> from loading
    (it's not currently in core) and then again after C<lib::core::only> so that
    the local paths are not removed.
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    lib::core::only is simply a shortcut to say "please reduce my @INC to only
    the core lib and archlib (architecture-specific lib) directories of this perl".
    
    You might want to do this to ensure a local::lib contains only the code you
    need, or to test an L<App::FatPacker|App::FatPacker> tree, or to avoid known
    bad vendor packages.
    
    You might want to use this to try and install a self-contained tree of perl
    modules. Be warned that that probably won't work (see L</CAVEATS>).
    
    This module was extracted from L<local::lib|local::lib>'s --self-contained
    feature, and contains the only part that ever worked. I apologise to anybody
    who thought anything else did.
    
    =head1 CAVEATS
    
    This does B<not> propagate properly across perl invocations like local::lib's
    stuff does. It can't. It's only a module import, so it B<only affects the
    specific perl VM instance in which you load and import() it>.
    
    If you want to cascade it across invocations, you can set the PERL5OPT
    environment variable to '-Mlib::core::only' and it'll sort of work. But be
    aware that taint mode ignores this, so some modules' build and test code
    probably will as well.
    
    You also need to be aware that perl's command line options are not processed
    in order - -I options take effect before -M options, so
    
      perl -Mlib::core::only -Ilib
    
    is unlike to do what you want - it's exactly equivalent to:
    
      perl -Mlib::core::only
    
    If you want to combine a core-only @INC with additional paths, you need to
    add the additional paths using -M options and the L<lib|lib> module:
    
      perl -Mlib::core::only -Mlib=lib
    
      # or if you're trying to test compiled code:
    
      perl -Mlib::core::only -Mblib
    
    For more information on the impossibility of sanely propagating this across
    module builds without help from the build program, see
    L<http://www.shadowcat.co.uk/blog/matt-s-trout/tainted-love> - and for ways
    to achieve the old --self-contained feature's results, look at
    L<App::FatPacker|App::FatPacker>'s tree function, and at
    L<App::cpanminus|cpanm>'s --local-lib-contained feature.

    FATAL: The local::lib --self-contained flag has never worked reliably and the

    such, this flag has been removed from the local::lib codebase in order to
    prevent misunderstandings and potentially broken builds. The local::lib authors
    recommend that you look at the lib::core::only module shipped with this
    distribution in order to create a more robust environment that is equivalent to

    =head1 NAME
    
    local::lib - create and use a local lib/ for perl modules with PERL5LIB
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
    In code -
    
      use local::lib; # sets up a local lib at ~/perl5
    
      use local::lib '~/foo'; # same, but ~/foo
    
      # Or...
      use FindBin;
      use local::lib "$FindBin::Bin/../support";  # app-local support library
    
    From the shell -
    
      # Install LWP and its missing dependencies to the '~/perl5' directory
      perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(LWP)'
    
      # Just print out useful shell commands
      $ perl -Mlocal::lib
      PERL_MB_OPT='--install_base /home/username/perl5'; export PERL_MB_OPT;
      PERL_MM_OPT='INSTALL_BASE=/home/username/perl5'; export PERL_MM_OPT;
      PERL5LIB="/home/username/perl5/lib/perl5"; export PERL5LIB;
      PATH="/home/username/perl5/bin:$PATH"; export PATH;
      PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT="/home/usename/perl5:$PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT"; export PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT;
    
    From a .bashrc file -
    
      [ $SHLVL -eq 1 ] && eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"
    
    =head2 The bootstrapping technique
    
    A typical way to install local::lib is using what is known as the
    "bootstrapping" technique.  You would do this if your system administrator
    hasn't already installed local::lib.  In this case, you'll need to install
    local::lib in your home directory.
    
    Even if you do have administrative privileges, you will still want to set up your
    environment variables, as discussed in step 4. Without this, you would still
    install the modules into the system CPAN installation and also your Perl scripts
    will not use the lib/ path you bootstrapped with local::lib.
    
    By default local::lib installs itself and the CPAN modules into ~/perl5.
    
    Windows users must also see L</Differences when using this module under Win32>.
    
    =over 4
    
    =item 1.
    
    Download and unpack the local::lib tarball from CPAN (search for "Download"
    on the CPAN page about local::lib).  Do this as an ordinary user, not as root
    or administrator.  Unpack the file in your home directory or in any other
    convenient location.
    
    =item 2.
    
    Run this:
    
      perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap
    
    If the system asks you whether it should automatically configure as much
    as possible, you would typically answer yes.
    
    In order to install local::lib into a directory other than the default, you need
    to specify the name of the directory when you call bootstrap, as follows:
    
      perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap=~/foo
    
    =item 3.
    
    Run this: (local::lib assumes you have make installed on your system)
    
      make test && make install
    
    =item 4.
    
    Now we need to setup the appropriate environment variables, so that Perl
    starts using our newly generated lib/ directory. If you are using bash or
    any other Bourne shells, you can add this to your shell startup script this
    way:
    
      echo '[ $SHLVL -eq 1 ] && eval "$(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)"' >>~/.bashrc
    
    If you are using C shell, you can do this as follows:
    
      /bin/csh
      echo $SHELL
      /bin/csh
      echo 'eval `perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib`' >> ~/.cshrc
    
    If you passed to bootstrap a directory other than default, you also need to
    give that as import parameter to the call of the local::lib module like this
    way:
    
      echo '[ $SHLVL -eq 1 ] && eval "$(perl -I$HOME/foo/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib=$HOME/foo)"' >>~/.bashrc
    
    After writing your shell configuration file, be sure to re-read it to get the
    changed settings into your current shell's environment. Bourne shells use
    C<. ~/.bashrc> for this, whereas C shells use C<source ~/.cshrc>.
    
    =back
    
    If you're on a slower machine, or are operating under draconian disk space
    limitations, you can disable the automatic generation of manpages from POD when
    installing modules by using the C<--no-manpages> argument when bootstrapping:
    
      perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap --no-manpages
    
    To avoid doing several bootstrap for several Perl module environments on the
    same account, for example if you use it for several different deployed
    applications independently, you can use one bootstrapped local::lib
    installation to install modules in different directories directly this way:
    
      cd ~/mydir1
      perl -Mlocal::lib=./
      eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=./)  ### To set the environment for this shell alone
      printenv                      ### You will see that ~/mydir1 is in the PERL5LIB
      perl -MCPAN -e install ...    ### whatever modules you want
      cd ../mydir2
      ... REPEAT ...
    
    When used in a C<.bashrc> file, it is recommended that you protect against
    re-activating a directory in a sub-shell.  This can be done by checking the
    C<$SHLVL> variable as shown in synopsis.  Without this, sub-shells created by
    the user or other programs will override changes made to the parent shell's
    environment.
    
    If you are working with several C<local::lib> environments, you may want to
    remove some of them from the current environment without disturbing the others.
    You can deactivate one environment like this (using bourne sh):
    
      eval $(perl -Mlocal::lib=--deactivate,~/path)
    
    which will generate and run the commands needed to remove C<~/path> from your
    various search paths. Whichever environment was B<activated most recently> will
    remain the target for module installations. That is, if you activate
    C<~/path_A> and then you activate C<~/path_B>, new modules you install will go
    in C<~/path_B>. If you deactivate C<~/path_B> then modules will be installed
    into C<~/pathA> -- but if you deactivate C<~/path_A> then they will still be
    installed in C<~/pathB> because pathB was activated later.
    
    You can also ask C<local::lib> to clean itself completely out of the current
    shell's environment with the C<--deactivate-all> option.
    For multiple environments for multiple apps you may need to include a modified
    version of the C<< use FindBin >> instructions in the "In code" sample above.
    If you did something like the above, you have a set of Perl modules at C<<
    ~/mydir1/lib >>. If you have a script at C<< ~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl >>,
    you need to tell it where to find the modules you installed for it at C<<
    ~/mydir1/lib >>.
    
    In C<< ~/mydir1/scripts/myscript.pl >>:
    
      use strict;
      use warnings;
      use local::lib "$FindBin::Bin/..";  ### points to ~/mydir1 and local::lib finds lib
      use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";     ### points to ~/mydir1/lib
    
    Put this before any BEGIN { ... } blocks that require the modules you installed.
    
    =head2 Differences when using this module under Win32
    
    To set up the proper environment variables for your current session of
    C<CMD.exe>, you can use this:
    
      C:\>perl -Mlocal::lib
      set PERL_MB_OPT=--install_base C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5
      set PERL_MM_OPT=INSTALL_BASE=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5
      set PERL5LIB=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\lib\perl5
      set PATH=C:\DOCUME~1\ADMINI~1\perl5\bin;%PATH%
    
      ### To set the environment for this shell alone
      C:\>perl -Mlocal::lib > %TEMP%\tmp.bat && %TEMP%\tmp.bat && del %TEMP%\tmp.bat
      ### instead of $(perl -Mlocal::lib=./)
    
    If you want the environment entries to persist, you'll need to add them to the
    Control Panel's System applet yourself or use L<App::local::lib::Win32Helper>.
    
    The "~" is translated to the user's profile directory (the directory named for
    the user under "Documents and Settings" (Windows XP or earlier) or "Users"
    (Windows Vista or later)) unless $ENV{HOME} exists. After that, the home
    directory is translated to a short name (which means the directory must exist)
    and the subdirectories are created.
    
    =head3 PowerShell
    
    local::lib also supports PowerShell, and can be used with the
    C<Invoke-Expression> cmdlet.
    
      Invoke-Expression "$(perl -Mlocal::lib)"
    
    =head1 RATIONALE
    
    The version of a Perl package on your machine is not always the version you
    need.  Obviously, the best thing to do would be to update to the version you
    need.  However, you might be in a situation where you're prevented from doing
    this.  Perhaps you don't have system administrator privileges; or perhaps you
    are using a package management system such as Debian, and nobody has yet gotten
    around to packaging up the version you need.
    
    local::lib solves this problem by allowing you to create your own directory of
    Perl packages downloaded from CPAN (in a multi-user system, this would typically
    be within your own home directory).  The existing system Perl installation is
    not affected; you simply invoke Perl with special options so that Perl uses the
    packages in your own local package directory rather than the system packages.
    local::lib arranges things so that your locally installed version of the Perl
    packages takes precedence over the system installation.
    
    If you are using a package management system (such as Debian), you don't need to
    worry about Debian and CPAN stepping on each other's toes.  Your local version
    of the packages will be written to an entirely separate directory from those
    installed by Debian.
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    This module provides a quick, convenient way of bootstrapping a user-local Perl
    module library located within the user's home directory. It also constructs and
    prints out for the user the list of environment variables using the syntax
    appropriate for the user's current shell (as specified by the C<SHELL>
    environment variable), suitable for directly adding to one's shell
    configuration file.
    
    More generally, local::lib allows for the bootstrapping and usage of a
    directory containing Perl modules outside of Perl's C<@INC>. This makes it
    easier to ship an application with an app-specific copy of a Perl module, or
    collection of modules. Useful in cases like when an upstream maintainer hasn't
    applied a patch to a module of theirs that you need for your application.
    
    On import, local::lib sets the following environment variables to appropriate
    values:
    
    =over 4
    
    =item PERL_MB_OPT
    
    =item PERL_MM_OPT
    
    =item PERL5LIB
    
    =item PATH
    
    =item PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT
    
    =back
    
    When possible, these will be appended to instead of overwritten entirely.
    
    These values are then available for reference by any code after import.
    
    =head1 CREATING A SELF-CONTAINED SET OF MODULES
    
    See L<lib::core::only> for one way to do this - but note that
    there are a number of caveats, and the best approach is always to perform a
    build against a clean perl (i.e. site and vendor as close to empty as possible).
    
    =head1 IMPORT OPTIONS
    
    Options are values that can be passed to the C<local::lib> import besides the
    directory to use. They are specified as C<use local::lib '--option'[, path];>
    or C<perl -Mlocal::lib=--option[,path]>.
    
    =head2 --deactivate
    
    Remove the chosen path (or the default path) from the module search paths if it
    was added by C<local::lib>, instead of adding it.
    
    =head2 --deactivate-all
    
    Remove all directories that were added to search paths by C<local::lib> from the
    search paths.
    
    =head2 --shelltype
    
    Specify the shell type to use for output.  By default, the shell will be
    detected based on the environment.  Should be one of: C<bourne>, C<csh>,
    C<cmd>, or C<powershell>.
    
    =head2 --no-create
    
    Prevents C<local::lib> from creating directories when activating dirs.  This is
    likely to cause issues on Win32 systems.

    =head1 A WARNING ABOUT UNINST=1
    
    Be careful about using local::lib in combination with "make install UNINST=1".
    The idea of this feature is that will uninstall an old version of a module
    before installing a new one. However it lacks a safety check that the old
    version and the new version will go in the same directory. Used in combination
    with local::lib, you can potentially delete a globally accessible version of a
    module while installing the new version in a local place. Only combine "make
    install UNINST=1" and local::lib if you understand these possible consequences.
    
    =head1 LIMITATIONS
    
    =over 4
    
    =item * Directory names with spaces in them are not well supported by the perl
    toolchain and the programs it uses.  Pure-perl distributions should support
    spaces, but problems are more likely with dists that require compilation. A
    workaround you can do is moving your local::lib to a directory with spaces
    B<after> you installed all modules inside your local::lib bootstrap. But be
    aware that you can't update or install CPAN modules after the move.
    
    =item * Rather basic shell detection. Right now anything with csh in its name is
    assumed to be a C shell or something compatible, and everything else is assumed
    to be Bourne, except on Win32 systems. If the C<SHELL> environment variable is
    not set, a Bourne-compatible shell is assumed.
    
    =item * Kills any existing PERL_MM_OPT or PERL_MB_OPT.
    
    =item * Should probably auto-fixup CPAN config if not already done.
    
    =item * On VMS and MacOS Classic (pre-OS X), local::lib loads L<File::Spec>.
    This means any L<File::Spec> version installed in the local::lib will be
    ignored by scripts using local::lib.  A workaround for this is using
    C<use lib "$local_lib/lib/perl5";> instead of using C<local::lib> directly.
    
    =item * Conflicts with L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>'s C<PREFIX> option.
    C<local::lib> uses the C<INSTALL_BASE> option, as it has more predictable and
    sane behavior.  If something attempts to use the C<PREFIX> option when running
    a F<Makefile.PL>, L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> will refuse to run, as the two
    options conflict.  This can be worked around by temporarily unsetting the
    C<PERL_MM_OPT> environment variable.
    
    =item * Conflicts with L<Module::Build>'s C<--prefix> option.  Similar to the
    previous limitation, but any C<--prefix> option specified will be ignored.
    This can be worked around by temporarily unsetting the C<PERL_MB_OPT>
    environment variable.
    
    =back
    
    Patches very much welcome for any of the above.
    
    =over 4
    
    =item * On Win32 systems, does not have a way to write the created environment
    variables to the registry, so that they can persist through a reboot.
    
    =back
    
    =head1 TROUBLESHOOTING
    
    If you've configured local::lib to install CPAN modules somewhere in to your
    home directory, and at some point later you try to install a module with C<cpan
    -i Foo::Bar>, but it fails with an error like: C<Warning: You do not have
    permissions to install into /usr/lib64/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/x86_64-linux at
    /usr/lib64/perl5/5.8.8/Foo/Bar.pm> and buried within the install log is an
    error saying C<'INSTALL_BASE' is not a known MakeMaker parameter name>, then
    you've somehow lost your updated ExtUtils::MakeMaker module.
    
    To remedy this situation, rerun the bootstrapping procedure documented above.
    
    Then, run C<rm -r ~/.cpan/build/Foo-Bar*>
    
    Finally, re-run C<cpan -i Foo::Bar> and it should install without problems.

    =head1 NAME
    
    parent - Establish an ISA relationship with base classes at compile time
    
    =head1 SYNOPSIS
    
        package Baz;
        use parent qw(Foo Bar);
    
    =head1 DESCRIPTION
    
    Allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up inheritance from
    those modules at the same time.  Mostly similar in effect to
    
        package Baz;
        BEGIN {
            require Foo;
            require Bar;
            push @ISA, qw(Foo Bar);
        }
    
    By default, every base class needs to live in a file of its own.
    If you want to have a subclass and its parent class in the same file, you
    can tell C<parent> not to load any modules by using the C<-norequire> switch:
    
      package Foo;
      sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }
    
      package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
      use parent -norequire, 'Foo', 'Bar';
      # will not go looking for Foo.pm or Bar.pm
    
    This is equivalent to the following code:
    
      package Foo;
      sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }
    
      package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
      push @DoesNotLoadFooBar::ISA, 'Foo', 'Bar';
    
    This is also helpful for the case where a package lives within
    a differently named file:
    
      package MyHash;
      use Tie::Hash;
      use parent -norequire, 'Tie::StdHash';
    
    This is equivalent to the following code:
    
      package MyHash;
      require Tie::Hash;
      push @ISA, 'Tie::StdHash';
    
    If you want to load a subclass from a file that C<require> would
    not consider an eligible filename (that is, it does not end in
    either C<.pm> or C<.pmc>), use the following code:
    
      package MySecondPlugin;
      require './plugins/custom.plugin'; # contains Plugin::Custom
      use parent -norequire, 'Plugin::Custom';
    
    =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
    
    =over 4
    
    =item Class 'Foo' tried to inherit from itself
    
    Attempting to inherit from yourself generates a warning.

  =head1 NAME
  
  cpanm - get, unpack build and install modules from CPAN
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    cpanm Test::More                                 # install Test::More
    cpanm MIYAGAWA/Plack-0.99_05.tar.gz              # full distribution path

    cpanm --installdeps .                            # install all the deps for the current directory
    cpanm -L extlib Plack                            # install Plack and all non-core deps into extlib

    cpanm --from https://cpan.metacpan.org/ Plack    # use only the HTTPS mirror
  
  =head1 COMMANDS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item (arguments)
  
  Command line arguments can be either a module name, distribution file,
  local file path, HTTP URL or git repository URL. Following commands
  will all work as you expect.
  
      cpanm Plack
      cpanm Plack/Request.pm
      cpanm MIYAGAWA/Plack-1.0000.tar.gz
      cpanm /path/to/Plack-1.0000.tar.gz
      cpanm http://cpan.metacpan.org/authors/id/M/MI/MIYAGAWA/Plack-0.9990.tar.gz
      cpanm git://github.com/plack/Plack.git
  
  Additionally, you can use the notation using C<~> and C<@> to specify
  version for a given module. C<~> specifies the version requirement in
  the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> format, while C<@> pins the exact version, and
  is a shortcut for C<~"== VERSION">.
  
      cpanm Plack~1.0000                 # 1.0000 or later
      cpanm Plack~">= 1.0000, < 2.0000"  # latest of 1.xxxx
      cpanm Plack@0.9990                 # specific version. same as Plack~"== 0.9990"
  
  The version query including specific version or range will be sent to
  L<MetaCPAN> to search for previous releases. The query will search for
  BackPAN archives by default, unless you specify C<--dev> option, in
  which case, archived versions will be filtered out.
  
  For a git repository, you can specify a branch, tag, or commit SHA to
  build. The default is C<master>
  
      cpanm git://github.com/plack/Plack.git@1.0000        # tag
      cpanm git://github.com/plack/Plack.git@devel         # branch
  
  =item -i, --install
  
  Installs the modules. This is a default behavior and this is just a
  compatibility option to make it work like L<cpan> or L<cpanp>.
  
  =item --self-upgrade
  
  Upgrades itself. It's just an alias for:
  
    cpanm App::cpanminus
  
  =item --info
  
  Displays the distribution information in
  C<AUTHOR/Dist-Name-ver.tar.gz> format in the standard out.
  
  =item --installdeps
  
  Installs the dependencies of the target distribution but won't build
  itself. Handy if you want to try the application from a version
  controlled repository such as git.
  
    cpanm --installdeps .
  
  =item --look
  
  Download and unpack the distribution and then open the directory with
  your shell. Handy to poke around the source code or do manual
  testing.
  
  =item -h, --help
  
  Displays the help message.
  
  =item -V, --version
  
  Displays the version number.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 OPTIONS
  
  You can specify the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT> environment variable.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item -f, --force
  
  Force install modules even when testing failed.
  
  =item -n, --notest
  
  Skip the testing of modules. Use this only when you just want to save
  time for installing hundreds of distributions to the same perl and
  architecture you've already tested to make sure it builds fine.
  
  Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-notest> to override when it
  is set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.
  
  =item --test-only
  
  Run the tests only, and do not install the specified module or
  distributions. Handy if you want to verify the new (or even old)
  releases pass its unit tests without installing the module.
  
  Note that if you specify this option with a module or distribution
  that has dependencies, these dependencies will be installed if you
  don't currently have them.
  
  =item -S, --sudo
  
  Switch to the root user with C<sudo> when installing modules. Use this
  if you want to install modules to the system perl include path.
  
  Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-sudo> to override when it is
  set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.
  
  =item -v, --verbose
  
  Makes the output verbose. It also enables the interactive
  configuration. (See --interactive)
  
  =item -q, --quiet
  
  Makes the output even more quiet than the default. It only shows the
  successful/failed dependencies to the output.
  
  =item -l, --local-lib
  
  Sets the L<local::lib> compatible path to install modules to. You
  don't need to set this if you already configure the shell environment
  variables using L<local::lib>, but this can be used to override that
  as well.
  
  =item -L, --local-lib-contained
  
  Same with C<--local-lib> but with L<--self-contained> set.  All
  non-core dependencies will be installed even if they're already
  installed.
  
  For instance,
  
    cpanm -L extlib Plack
  
  would install Plack and all of its non-core dependencies into the
  directory C<extlib>, which can be loaded from your application with:
  
    use local::lib '/path/to/extlib';
  
  Note that this option does B<NOT> reliably work with perl installations
  supplied by operating system vendors that strips standard modules from perl,
  such as RHEL, Fedora and CentOS, B<UNLESS> you also install packages supplying
  all the modules that have been stripped.  For these systems you will probably
  want to install the C<perl-core> meta-package which does just that.
  
  =item --self-contained
  
  When examining the dependencies, assume no non-core modules are
  installed on the system. Handy if you want to bundle application
  dependencies in one directory so you can distribute to other machines.
  
  =item --exclude-vendor
  
  Don't include modules installed under the 'vendor' paths when searching for
  core modules when the C<--self-contained> flag is in effect.  This restores
  the behaviour from before version 1.7023
  
  =item --mirror
  
  Specifies the base URL for the CPAN mirror to use, such as
  C<http://cpan.cpantesters.org/> (you can omit the trailing slash). You
  can specify multiple mirror URLs by repeating the command line option.
  
  You can use a local directory that has a CPAN mirror structure
  (created by tools such as L<OrePAN> or L<Pinto>) by using a special
  URL scheme C<file://>. If the given URL begins with `/` (without any
  scheme), it is considered as a file scheme as well.
  
    cpanm --mirror file:///path/to/mirror
    cpanm --mirror ~/minicpan      # Because shell expands ~ to /home/user
  
  Defaults to C<http://www.cpan.org/>.
  
  =item --mirror-only
  
  Download the mirror's 02packages.details.txt.gz index file instead of
  querying the CPAN Meta DB. This will also effectively opt out sending
  your local perl versions to backend database servers such as CPAN Meta
  DB and MetaCPAN.
  
  Select this option if you are using a local mirror of CPAN, such as
  minicpan when you're offline, or your own CPAN index (a.k.a darkpan).
  
  =item --from, -M
  
    cpanm -M https://cpan.metacpan.org/
    cpanm --from https://cpan.metacpan.org/
  
  Use the given mirror URL and its index as the I<only> source to search
  and download modules from.
  
  It works similar to C<--mirror> and C<--mirror-only> combined, with a
  small difference: unlike C<--mirror> which I<appends> the URL to the
  list of mirrors, C<--from> (or C<-M> for short) uses the specified URL
  as its I<only> source to download index and modules from. This makes
  the option always override the default mirror, which might have been
  set via global options such as the one set by C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>
  environment variable.
  
  B<Tip:> It might be useful if you name these options with your shell
  aliases, like:
  
    alias minicpanm='cpanm --from ~/minicpan'
    alias darkpan='cpanm --from http://mycompany.example.com/DPAN'
  
  =item --mirror-index
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies the file path to C<02packages.details.txt>
  for module search index.
  
  =item --cpanmetadb
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies an alternate URI for CPAN MetaDB index lookups.
  
  =item --metacpan
  
  Prefers MetaCPAN API over CPAN MetaDB.
  
  =item --cpanfile
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specified an alternate path for cpanfile to search for,
  when C<--installdeps> command is in use. Defaults to C<cpanfile>.
  
  =item --prompt
  
  Prompts when a test fails so that you can skip, force install, retry
  or look in the shell to see what's going wrong. It also prompts when
  one of the dependency failed if you want to proceed the installation.
  
  Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-prompt> to override if it's
  set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.
  
  =item --dev
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: search for a newer developer release as well. Defaults to false.
  
  =item --reinstall
  
  cpanm, when given a module name in the command line (i.e. C<cpanm
  Plack>), checks the locally installed version first and skips if it is
  already installed. This option makes it skip the check, so:
  
    cpanm --reinstall Plack
  
  would reinstall L<Plack> even if your locally installed version is
  latest, or even newer (which would happen if you install a developer
  release from version control repositories).
  
  Defaults to false.
  
  =item --interactive
  
  Makes the configuration (such as C<Makefile.PL> and C<Build.PL>)
  interactive, so you can answer questions in the distribution that
  requires custom configuration or Task:: distributions.
  
  Defaults to false, and you can say C<--no-interactive> to override
  when it's set in the default options in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.
  
  =item --pp, --pureperl
  
  Prefer Pure perl build of modules by setting C<PUREPERL_ONLY=1> for
  MakeMaker and C<--pureperl-only> for Build.PL based
  distributions. Note that not all of the CPAN modules support this
  convention yet.
  
  =item --with-recommends, --with-suggests
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Installs dependencies declared as C<recommends> and
  C<suggests> respectively, per META spec. When these dependencies fail
  to install, cpanm continues the installation, since they're just
  recommendation/suggestion.
  
  Enabling this could potentially make a circular dependency for a few
  modules on CPAN, when C<recommends> adds a module that C<recommends>
  back the module in return.
  
  There's also C<--without-recommend> and C<--without-suggests> to
  override the default decision made earlier in C<PERL_CPANM_OPT>.
  
  Defaults to false for both.
  
  =item --with-develop
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Installs develop phase dependencies in META files or
  C<cpanfile> when used with C<--installdeps>. Defaults to false.
  
  =item --with-feature, --without-feature, --with-all-features
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies the feature to enable, if a module supports
  optional features per META spec 2.0.
  
      cpanm --with-feature=opt_csv Spreadsheet::Read
  
  the features can also be interactively chosen when C<--interactive>
  option is enabled.
  
  C<--with-all-features> enables all the optional features, and
  C<--without-feature> can select a feature to disable.
  
  =item --configure-timeout, --build-timeout, --test-timeout
  
  Specify the timeout length (in seconds) to wait for the configure,
  build and test process. Current default values are: 60 for configure,
  3600 for build and 1800 for test.
  
  =item --configure-args, --build-args, --test-args, --install-args
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Pass arguments for configure/build/test/install
  commands respectively, for a given module to install.
  
      cpanm DBD::mysql --configure-args="--cflags=... --libs=..."
  
  The argument is only enabled for the module passed as a command line
  argument, not dependencies.
  
  =item --scandeps
  
  B<DEPRECATED>: Scans the depencencies of given modules and output the
  tree in a text format. (See C<--format> below for more options)
  
  Because this command doesn't actually install any distributions, it
  will be useful that by typing:
  
    cpanm --scandeps Catalyst::Runtime
  
  you can make sure what modules will be installed.
  
  This command takes into account which modules you already have
  installed in your system. If you want to see what modules will be
  installed against a vanilla perl installation, you might want to
  combine it with C<-L> option.
  
  =item --format
  
  B<DEPRECATED>: Determines what format to display the scanned
  dependency tree. Available options are C<tree>, C<json>, C<yaml> and
  C<dists>.
  
  =over 8
  
  =item tree
  
  Displays the tree in a plain text format. This is the default value.
  
  =item json, yaml
  
  Outputs the tree in a JSON or YAML format. L<JSON> and L<YAML> modules
  need to be installed respectively. The output tree is represented as a
  recursive tuple of:
  
    [ distribution, dependencies ]
  
  and the container is an array containing the root elements. Note that
  there may be multiple root nodes, since you can give multiple modules
  to the C<--scandeps> command.
  
  =item dists
  
  C<dists> is a special output format, where it prints the distribution
  filename in the I<depth first order> after the dependency resolution,
  like:
  
    GAAS/MIME-Base64-3.13.tar.gz
    GAAS/URI-1.58.tar.gz
    PETDANCE/HTML-Tagset-3.20.tar.gz
    GAAS/HTML-Parser-3.68.tar.gz
    GAAS/libwww-perl-5.837.tar.gz
  
  which means you can install these distributions in this order without
  extra dependencies. When combined with C<-L> option, it will be useful
  to replay installations on other machines.
  
  =back
  
  =item --save-dists
  
  Specifies the optional directory path to copy downloaded tarballs in
  the CPAN mirror compatible directory structure
  i.e. I<authors/id/A/AU/AUTHORS/Foo-Bar-version.tar.gz>
  
  If the distro tarball did not come from CPAN, for example from a local
  file or from GitHub, then it will be saved under
  I<vendor/Foo-Bar-version.tar.gz>.
  
  =item --uninst-shadows
  
  Uninstalls the shadow files of the distribution that you're
  installing. This eliminates the confusion if you're trying to install
  core (dual-life) modules from CPAN against perl 5.10 or older, or
  modules that used to be XS-based but switched to pure perl at some
  version.
  
  If you run cpanm as root and use C<INSTALL_BASE> or equivalent to
  specify custom installation path, you SHOULD disable this option so
  you won't accidentally uninstall dual-life modules from the core
  include path.
  
  Defaults to true if your perl version is smaller than 5.12, and you
  can disable that with C<--no-uninst-shadows>.
  
  B<NOTE>: Since version 1.3000 this flag is turned off by default for
  perl newer than 5.12, since with 5.12 @INC contains site_perl directory
  I<before> the perl core library path, and uninstalling shadows is not
  necessary anymore and does more harm by deleting files from the core
  library path.
  
  =item --uninstall, -U
  
  Uninstalls a module from the library path. It finds a packlist for
  given modules, and removes all the files included in the same
  distribution.
  
  If you enable local::lib, it only removes files from the local::lib
  directory.
  
  If you try to uninstall a module in C<perl> directory (i.e. core
  module), an error will be thrown.
  
  A dialog will be prompted to confirm the files to be deleted. If you pass
  C<-f> option as well, the dialog will be skipped and uninstallation
  will be forced.
  
  =item --cascade-search
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies whether to cascade search when you specify
  multiple mirrors and a mirror doesn't have a module or has a lower
  version of the module than requested. Defaults to false.
  
  =item --skip-installed
  
  Specifies whether a module given in the command line is skipped if its latest
  version is already installed. Defaults to true.
  
  B<NOTE>: The C<PERL5LIB> environment variable have to be correctly set
  for this to work with modules installed using L<local::lib>, unless
  you always use the C<-l> option.
  
  =item --skip-satisfied
  
  B<EXPERIMENTAL>: Specifies whether a module (and version) given in the
  command line is skipped if it's already installed.
  
  If you run:
  
    cpanm --skip-satisfied CGI DBI~1.2
  
  cpanm won't install them if you already have CGI (for whatever
  versions) or have DBI with version higher than 1.2. It is similar to
  C<--skip-installed> but while C<--skip-installed> checks if the
  I<latest> version of CPAN is installed, C<--skip-satisfied> checks if
  a requested version (or not, which means any version) is installed.
  
  Defaults to false.
  
  =item --verify
  
  Verify the integrity of distribution files retrieved from PAUSE using
  CHECKSUMS and SIGNATURES (if found). Defaults to false.
  
  =item --report-perl-version
  
  Whether it reports the locally installed perl version to the various
  web server as part of User-Agent. Defaults to true unless CI related
  environment variables such as C<TRAVIS>, C<CI> or C<AUTOMATED_TESTING>
  is enabled. You can disable it by using C<--no-report-perl-version>.
  
  =item --auto-cleanup
  
  Specifies the number of days in which cpanm's work directories
  expire. Defaults to 7, which means old work directories will be
  cleaned up in one week.
  
  You can set the value to C<0> to make cpan never cleanup those
  directories.
  
  =item --man-pages
  
  Generates man pages for executables (man1) and libraries (man3).
  
  Defaults to true (man pages generated) unless C<-L|--local-lib-contained>
  option is supplied in which case it's set to false. You can disable
  it with C<--no-man-pages>.
  
  =item --lwp
  
  Uses L<LWP> module to download stuff over HTTP. Defaults to true, and
  you can say C<--no-lwp> to disable using LWP, when you want to upgrade
  LWP from CPAN on some broken perl systems.
  
  =item --wget
  
  Uses GNU Wget (if available) to download stuff. Defaults to true, and
  you can say C<--no-wget> to disable using Wget (versions of Wget older
  than 1.9 don't support the C<--retry-connrefused> option used by cpanm).
  
  =item --curl
  
  Uses cURL (if available) to download stuff. Defaults to true, and
  you can say C<--no-curl> to disable using cURL.
  
  Normally with C<--lwp>, C<--wget> and C<--curl> options set to true
  (which is the default) cpanm tries L<LWP>, Wget, cURL and L<HTTP::Tiny>
  (in that order) and uses the first one available.

  #pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
  #pod
  #pod Software distributions released to the CPAN include a F<META.json> or, for
  #pod older distributions, F<META.yml>, which describes the distribution, its
  #pod contents, and the requirements for building and installing the distribution.
  #pod The data structure stored in the F<META.json> file is described in
  #pod L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.
  #pod
  #pod CPAN::Meta provides a simple class to represent this distribution metadata (or
  #pod I<distmeta>), along with some helpful methods for interrogating that data.
  #pod
  #pod The documentation below is only for the methods of the CPAN::Meta object.  For
  #pod information on the meaning of individual fields, consult the spec.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Software distributions released to the CPAN include a F<META.json> or, for
  older distributions, F<META.yml>, which describes the distribution, its
  contents, and the requirements for building and installing the distribution.
  The data structure stored in the F<META.json> file is described in
  L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.
  
  CPAN::Meta provides a simple class to represent this distribution metadata (or
  I<distmeta>), along with some helpful methods for interrogating that data.
  
  The documentation below is only for the methods of the CPAN::Meta object.  For
  information on the meaning of individual fields, consult the spec.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 new
  
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->new($distmeta_struct, \%options);
  
  Returns a valid CPAN::Meta object or dies if the supplied metadata hash
  reference fails to validate.  Older-format metadata will be up-converted to
  version 2 if they validate against the original stated specification.
  
  It takes an optional hashref of options. Valid options include:
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  lazy_validation -- if true, new will attempt to convert the given metadata
  to version 2 before attempting to validate it.  This means than any
  fixable errors will be handled by CPAN::Meta::Converter before validation.
  (Note that this might result in invalid optional data being silently
  dropped.)  The default is false.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 create
  
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->create($distmeta_struct, \%options);
  
  This is same as C<new()>, except that C<generated_by> and C<meta-spec> fields
  will be generated if not provided.  This means the metadata structure is
  assumed to otherwise follow the latest L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.
  
  =head2 load_file
  
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file($distmeta_file, \%options);
  
  Given a pathname to a file containing metadata, this deserializes the file
  according to its file suffix and constructs a new C<CPAN::Meta> object, just
  like C<new()>.  It will die if the deserialized version fails to validate
  against its stated specification version.
  
  It takes the same options as C<new()> but C<lazy_validation> defaults to
  true.
  
  =head2 load_yaml_string
  
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_yaml_string($yaml, \%options);
  
  This method returns a new CPAN::Meta object using the first document in the
  given YAML string.  In other respects it is identical to C<load_file()>.
  
  =head2 load_json_string
  
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_json_string($json, \%options);
  
  This method returns a new CPAN::Meta object using the structure represented by
  the given JSON string.  In other respects it is identical to C<load_file()>.
  
  =head2 load_string
  
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_string($string, \%options);
  
  If you don't know if a string contains YAML or JSON, this method will use
  L<Parse::CPAN::Meta> to guess.  In other respects it is identical to
  C<load_file()>.
  
  =head2 save
  
    $meta->save($distmeta_file, \%options);
  
  Serializes the object as JSON and writes it to the given file.  The only valid
  option is C<version>, which defaults to '2'. On Perl 5.8.1 or later, the file
  is saved with UTF-8 encoding.
  
  For C<version> 2 (or higher), the filename should end in '.json'.  L<JSON::PP>
  is the default JSON backend. Using another JSON backend requires L<JSON> 2.5 or
  later and you must set the C<$ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND}> to a supported alternate
  backend like L<JSON::XS>.
  
  For C<version> less than 2, the filename should end in '.yml'.
  L<CPAN::Meta::Converter> is used to generate an older metadata structure, which
  is serialized to YAML.  CPAN::Meta::YAML is the default YAML backend.  You may
  set the C<$ENV{PERL_YAML_BACKEND}> to a supported alternative backend, though
  this is not recommended due to subtle incompatibilities between YAML parsers on
  CPAN.
  
  =head2 meta_spec_version
  
  This method returns the version part of the C<meta_spec> entry in the distmeta
  structure.  It is equivalent to:
  
    $meta->meta_spec->{version};
  
  =head2 effective_prereqs
  
    my $prereqs = $meta->effective_prereqs;
  
    my $prereqs = $meta->effective_prereqs( \@feature_identifiers );
  
  This method returns a L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object describing all the
  prereqs for the distribution.  If an arrayref of feature identifiers is given,
  the prereqs for the identified features are merged together with the
  distribution's core prereqs before the CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object is returned.
  
  =head2 should_index_file
  
    ... if $meta->should_index_file( $filename );
  
  This method returns true if the given file should be indexed.  It decides this
  by checking the C<file> and C<directory> keys in the C<no_index> property of
  the distmeta structure. Note that neither the version format nor
  C<release_status> are considered.
  
  C<$filename> should be given in unix format.
  
  =head2 should_index_package
  
    ... if $meta->should_index_package( $package );
  
  This method returns true if the given package should be indexed.  It decides
  this by checking the C<package> and C<namespace> keys in the C<no_index>
  property of the distmeta structure. Note that neither the version format nor
  C<release_status> are considered.
  
  =head2 features
  
    my @feature_objects = $meta->features;
  
  This method returns a list of L<CPAN::Meta::Feature> objects, one for each
  optional feature described by the distribution's metadata.
  
  =head2 feature
  
    my $feature_object = $meta->feature( $identifier );
  
  This method returns a L<CPAN::Meta::Feature> object for the optional feature
  with the given identifier.  If no feature with that identifier exists, an
  exception will be raised.
  
  =head2 as_struct
  
    my $copy = $meta->as_struct( \%options );
  
  This method returns a deep copy of the object's metadata as an unblessed hash
  reference.  It takes an optional hashref of options.  If the hashref contains
  a C<version> argument, the copied metadata will be converted to the version
  of the specification and returned.  For example:
  
    my $old_spec = $meta->as_struct( {version => "1.4"} );
  
  =head2 as_string
  
    my $string = $meta->as_string( \%options );
  
  This method returns a serialized copy of the object's metadata as a character
  string.  (The strings are B<not> UTF-8 encoded.)  It takes an optional hashref
  of options.  If the hashref contains a C<version> argument, the copied metadata
  will be converted to the version of the specification and returned.  For
  example:
  
    my $string = $meta->as_string( {version => "1.4"} );
  
  For C<version> greater than or equal to 2, the string will be serialized as
  JSON.  For C<version> less than 2, the string will be serialized as YAML.  In
  both cases, the same rules are followed as in the C<save()> method for choosing
  a serialization backend.
  
  =head1 STRING DATA
  
  The following methods return a single value, which is the value for the
  corresponding entry in the distmeta structure.  Values should be either undef
  or strings.

  =head1 NAME
  
  CPAN::Meta::Converter - Convert CPAN distribution metadata structures
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 2.143240
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    my $struct = decode_json_file('META.json');
  
    my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct );
  
    my $new_struct = $cmc->convert( version => "2" );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module converts CPAN Meta structures from one form to another.  The
  primary use is to convert older structures to the most modern version of
  the specification, but other transformations may be implemented in the
  future as needed.  (E.g. stripping all custom fields or stripping all
  optional fields.)
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 new
  
    my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct );
  
  The constructor should be passed a valid metadata structure but invalid
  structures are accepted.  If no meta-spec version is provided, version 1.0 will
  be assumed.
  
  Optionally, you can provide a C<default_version> argument after C<$struct>:
  
    my $cmc = CPAN::Meta::Converter->new( $struct, default_version => "1.4" );
  
  This is only needed when converting a metadata fragment that does not include a
  C<meta-spec> field.
  
  =head2 convert
  
    my $new_struct = $cmc->convert( version => "2" );
  
  Returns a new hash reference with the metadata converted to a different form.
  C<convert> will die if any conversion/standardization still results in an
  invalid structure.
  
  Valid parameters include:
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  C<version> -- Indicates the desired specification version (e.g. "1.0", "1.1" ... "1.4", "2").
  Defaults to the latest version of the CPAN Meta Spec.
  
  =back
  
  Conversion proceeds through each version in turn.  For example, a version 1.2
  structure might be converted to 1.3 then 1.4 then finally to version 2. The
  conversion process attempts to clean-up simple errors and standardize data.
  For example, if C<author> is given as a scalar, it will converted to an array
  reference containing the item. (Converting a structure to its own version will
  also clean-up and standardize.)
  
  When data are cleaned and standardized, missing or invalid fields will be
  replaced with sensible defaults when possible.  This may be lossy or imprecise.
  For example, some badly structured META.yml files on CPAN have prerequisite
  modules listed as both keys and values:
  
    requires => { 'Foo::Bar' => 'Bam::Baz' }
  
  These would be split and each converted to a prerequisite with a minimum
  version of zero.
  
  When some mandatory fields are missing or invalid, the conversion will attempt
  to provide a sensible default or will fill them with a value of 'unknown'.  For
  example a missing or unrecognized C<license> field will result in a C<license>
  field of 'unknown'.  Fields that may get an 'unknown' include:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  abstract
  
  =item *
  
  author
  
  =item *
  
  license
  
  =back
  
  =head2 upgrade_fragment
  
    my $new_struct = $cmc->upgrade_fragment;
  
  Returns a new hash reference with the metadata converted to the latest version
  of the CPAN Meta Spec.  No validation is done on the result -- you must
  validate after merging fragments into a complete metadata document.

  =head1 NAME
  
  CPAN::Meta::History - history of CPAN Meta Spec changes
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 2.143240
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  The CPAN Meta Spec has gone through several iterations.  It was
  originally written in HTML and later revised into POD (though published
  in HTML generated from the POD).  Fields were added, removed or changed,
  sometimes by design and sometimes to reflect real-world usage after the
  fact.
  
  This document reconstructs the history of the CPAN Meta Spec based on
  change logs, repository commit messages and the published HTML files.
  In some cases, particularly prior to version 1.2, the exact version
  when certain fields were introduced or changed is inconsistent between
  sources.  When in doubt, the published HTML files for versions 1.0 to
  1.4 as they existed when version 2 was developed are used as the
  definitive source.
  
  Starting with version 2, the specification document is part of the
  CPAN-Meta distribution and will be published on CPAN as
  L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>.
  
  Going forward, specification version numbers will be integers and
  decimal portions will correspond to a release date for the CPAN::Meta
  library.

  CPAN::Meta::Merge - Merging CPAN Meta fragments
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 2.143240
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   my $merger = CPAN::Meta::Merge->new(default_version => "2");
   my $meta = $merger->merge($base, @additional);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 new
  
  This creates a CPAN::Meta::Merge object. It takes one mandatory named
  argument, C<version>, declaring the version of the meta-spec that must be
  used for the merge. It can optionally take an C<extra_mappings> argument
  that allows one to add additional merging functions for specific elements.
  
  =head2 merge(@fragments)
  
  Merge all C<@fragments> together. It will accept both CPAN::Meta objects and
  (possibly incomplete) hashrefs of metadata.

  #pod
  #pod This method returns a new set of Prereqs.  The input should look like the
  #pod contents of the C<prereqs> field described in L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>, meaning
  #pod something more or less like this:
  #pod
  #pod   my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new({

  #pod       },
  #pod       ...,
  #pod     },
  #pod     ...,
  #pod   });
  #pod
  #pod You can also construct an empty set of prereqs with:
  #pod
  #pod   my $prereqs = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new;
  #pod
  #pod This empty set of prereqs is useful for accumulating new prereqs before finally
  #pod dumping the whole set into a structure or string.

  =head1 NAME
  
  CPAN::Meta::Prereqs - a set of distribution prerequisites by phase and type
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 2.143240
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  A CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object represents the prerequisites for a CPAN
  distribution or one of its optional features.  Each set of prereqs is
  organized by phase and type, as described in L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs>.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 new
  
    my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new( \%prereq_spec );
  
  This method returns a new set of Prereqs.  The input should look like the
  contents of the C<prereqs> field described in L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>, meaning
  something more or less like this:
  
    my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new({
      runtime => {
        requires => {
          'Some::Module' => '1.234',
          ...,
        },
        ...,
      },
      ...,
    });
  
  You can also construct an empty set of prereqs with:
  
    my $prereqs = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new;
  
  This empty set of prereqs is useful for accumulating new prereqs before finally
  dumping the whole set into a structure or string.
  
  =head2 requirements_for
  
    my $requirements = $prereqs->requirements_for( $phase, $type );
  
  This method returns a L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object for the given
  phase/type combination.  If no prerequisites are registered for that
  combination, a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object will be returned, and it may
  be added to as needed.
  
  If C<$phase> or C<$type> are undefined or otherwise invalid, an exception will
  be raised.
  
  =head2 with_merged_prereqs
  
    my $new_prereqs = $prereqs->with_merged_prereqs( $other_prereqs );
  
    my $new_prereqs = $prereqs->with_merged_prereqs( \@other_prereqs );
  
  This method returns a new CPAN::Meta::Prereqs objects in which all the
  other prerequisites given are merged into the current set.  This is primarily
  provided for combining a distribution's core prereqs with the prereqs of one of
  its optional features.
  
  The new prereqs object has no ties to the originals, and altering it further
  will not alter them.
  
  =head2 merged_requirements
  
      my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements( \@phases, \@types );
      my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements( \@phases );
      my $new_reqs = $preerqs->merged_requirements();
  
  This method joins together all requirements across a number of phases
  and types into a new L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object.  If arguments
  are omitted, it defaults to "runtime", "build" and "test" for phases
  and "requires" and "recommends" for types.
  
  =head2 as_string_hash
  
  This method returns a hashref containing structures suitable for dumping into a
  distmeta data structure.  It is made up of hashes and strings, only; there will
  be no Prereqs, CPAN::Meta::Requirements, or C<version> objects inside it.
  
  =head2 is_finalized
  
  This method returns true if the set of prereqs has been marked "finalized," and
  cannot be altered.
  
  =head2 finalize
  
  Calling C<finalize> on a Prereqs object will close it for further modification.
  Attempting to make any changes that would actually alter the prereqs will
  result in an exception being thrown.
  
  =head2 clone
  
    my $cloned_prereqs = $prereqs->clone;
  
  This method returns a Prereqs object that is identical to the original object,
  but can be altered without affecting the original object.  Finalization does
  not survive cloning, meaning that you may clone a finalized set of prereqs and
  then modify the clone.

  #pod =head1 DESCRIPTION
  #pod
  #pod A CPAN::Meta::Requirements object models a set of version constraints like
  #pod those specified in the F<META.yml> or F<META.json> files in CPAN distributions,
  #pod and as defined by L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>;
  #pod It can be built up by adding more and more constraints, and it will reduce them
  #pod to the simplest representation.
  #pod
  #pod Logically impossible constraints will be identified immediately by thrown
  #pod exceptions.

  =head1 NAME
  
  CPAN::Meta::Requirements - a set of version requirements for a CPAN dist
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 2.131
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use CPAN::Meta::Requirements;
  
    my $build_requires = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->new;
  
    $build_requires->add_minimum('Library::Foo' => 1.208);
  
    $build_requires->add_minimum('Library::Foo' => 2.602);
  
    $build_requires->add_minimum('Module::Bar'  => 'v1.2.3');
  
    $METAyml->{build_requires} = $build_requires->as_string_hash;
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  A CPAN::Meta::Requirements object models a set of version constraints like
  those specified in the F<META.yml> or F<META.json> files in CPAN distributions,
  and as defined by L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>;
  It can be built up by adding more and more constraints, and it will reduce them
  to the simplest representation.
  
  Logically impossible constraints will be identified immediately by thrown
  exceptions.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 new
  
    my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->new;
  
  This returns a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object.  It takes an optional
  hash reference argument.  Currently, only one key is supported:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<bad_version_hook> -- if provided, when a version cannot be parsed into a version object, this code reference will be called with the invalid version string as first argument, and the module name as second argument.  It must return a valid version object.
  
  =back
  
  All other keys are ignored.
  
  =head2 add_minimum
  
    $req->add_minimum( $module => $version );
  
  This adds a new minimum version requirement.  If the new requirement is
  redundant to the existing specification, this has no effect.
  
  Minimum requirements are inclusive.  C<$version> is required, along with any
  greater version number.
  
  This method returns the requirements object.
  
  =head2 add_maximum
  
    $req->add_maximum( $module => $version );
  
  This adds a new maximum version requirement.  If the new requirement is
  redundant to the existing specification, this has no effect.
  
  Maximum requirements are inclusive.  No version strictly greater than the given
  version is allowed.
  
  This method returns the requirements object.
  
  =head2 add_exclusion
  
    $req->add_exclusion( $module => $version );
  
  This adds a new excluded version.  For example, you might use these three
  method calls:
  
    $req->add_minimum( $module => '1.00' );
    $req->add_maximum( $module => '1.82' );
  
    $req->add_exclusion( $module => '1.75' );
  
  Any version between 1.00 and 1.82 inclusive would be acceptable, except for
  1.75.
  
  This method returns the requirements object.
  
  =head2 exact_version
  
    $req->exact_version( $module => $version );
  
  This sets the version required for the given module to I<exactly> the given
  version.  No other version would be considered acceptable.
  
  This method returns the requirements object.
  
  =head2 add_requirements
  
    $req->add_requirements( $another_req_object );
  
  This method adds all the requirements in the given CPAN::Meta::Requirements object
  to the requirements object on which it was called.  If there are any conflicts,
  an exception is thrown.
  
  This method returns the requirements object.
  
  =head2 accepts_module
  
    my $bool = $req->accepts_module($module => $version);
  
  Given an module and version, this method returns true if the version
  specification for the module accepts the provided version.  In other words,
  given:
  
    Module => '>= 1.00, < 2.00'
  
  We will accept 1.00 and 1.75 but not 0.50 or 2.00.
  
  For modules that do not appear in the requirements, this method will return
  true.
  
  =head2 clear_requirement
  
    $req->clear_requirement( $module );
  
  This removes the requirement for a given module from the object.
  
  This method returns the requirements object.
  
  =head2 requirements_for_module
  
    $req->requirements_for_module( $module );
  
  This returns a string containing the version requirements for a given module in
  the format described in L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> or undef if the given module has no
  requirements. This should only be used for informational purposes such as error
  messages and should not be interpreted or used for comparison (see
  L</accepts_module> instead.)
  
  =head2 required_modules
  
  This method returns a list of all the modules for which requirements have been
  specified.
  
  =head2 clone
  
    $req->clone;
  
  This method returns a clone of the invocant.  The clone and the original object
  can then be changed independent of one another.
  
  =head2 is_simple
  
  This method returns true if and only if all requirements are inclusive minimums
  -- that is, if their string expression is just the version number.
  
  =head2 is_finalized
  
  This method returns true if the requirements have been finalized by having the
  C<finalize> method called on them.
  
  =head2 finalize
  
  This method marks the requirements finalized.  Subsequent attempts to change
  the requirements will be fatal, I<if> they would result in a change.  If they
  would not alter the requirements, they have no effect.
  
  If a finalized set of requirements is cloned, the cloned requirements are not
  also finalized.
  
  =head2 as_string_hash
  
  This returns a reference to a hash describing the requirements using the
  strings in the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> specification.
  
  For example after the following program:
  
    my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->new;
  
    $req->add_minimum('CPAN::Meta::Requirements' => 0.102);
  
    $req->add_minimum('Library::Foo' => 1.208);
  
    $req->add_maximum('Library::Foo' => 2.602);
  
    $req->add_minimum('Module::Bar'  => 'v1.2.3');
  
    $req->add_exclusion('Module::Bar'  => 'v1.2.8');
  
    $req->exact_version('Xyzzy'  => '6.01');
  
    my $hashref = $req->as_string_hash;
  
  C<$hashref> would contain:
  
    {
      'CPAN::Meta::Requirements' => '0.102',
      'Library::Foo' => '>= 1.208, <= 2.206',
      'Module::Bar'  => '>= v1.2.3, != v1.2.8',
      'Xyzzy'        => '== 6.01',
    }
  
  =head2 add_string_requirement
  
    $req->add_string_requirement('Library::Foo' => '>= 1.208, <= 2.206');
    $req->add_string_requirement('Library::Foo' => v1.208);
  
  This method parses the passed in string and adds the appropriate requirement
  for the given module.  A version can be a Perl "v-string".  It understands
  version ranges as described in the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec/Version Ranges>. For
  example:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item 1.3
  
  =item >= 1.3
  
  =item <= 1.3
  
  =item == 1.3
  
  =item != 1.3
  
  =item > 1.3
  
  =item < 1.3
  
  =item >= 1.3, != 1.5, <= 2.0
  
  A version number without an operator is equivalent to specifying a minimum
  (C<E<gt>=>).  Extra whitespace is allowed.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 from_string_hash
  
    my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->from_string_hash( \%hash );
    my $req = CPAN::Meta::Requirements->from_string_hash( \%hash, \%opts );
  
  This is an alternate constructor for a CPAN::Meta::Requirements
  object. It takes a hash of module names and version requirement
  strings and returns a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object. As with
  add_string_requirement, a version can be a Perl "v-string". Optionally,
  you can supply a hash-reference of options, exactly as with the L</new>
  method.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This document describes version 2 of the CPAN distribution metadata
  specification, also known as the "CPAN Meta Spec".
  
  Revisions of this specification for typo corrections and prose
  clarifications may be issued as CPAN::Meta::Spec 2.I<x>.  These
  revisions will never change semantics or add or remove specified
  behavior.
  
  Distribution metadata describe important properties of Perl
  distributions. Distribution building tools like Module::Build,
  Module::Install, ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Dist::Zilla should create a
  metadata file in accordance with this specification and include it with
  the distribution for use by automated tools that index, examine, package
  or install Perl distributions.
  
  =head1 TERMINOLOGY
  
  =over 4
  
  =item distribution
  
  This is the primary object described by the metadata. In the context of
  this document it usually refers to a collection of modules, scripts,
  and/or documents that are distributed together for other developers to
  use.  Examples of distributions are C<Class-Container>, C<libwww-perl>,
  or C<DBI>.
  
  =item module
  
  This refers to a reusable library of code contained in a single file.
  Modules usually contain one or more packages and are often referred
  to by the name of a primary package that can be mapped to the file
  name. For example, one might refer to C<File::Spec> instead of
  F<File/Spec.pm>
  
  =item package
  
  This refers to a namespace declared with the Perl C<package> statement.
  In Perl, packages often have a version number property given by the
  C<$VERSION> variable in the namespace.
  
  =item consumer
  
  This refers to code that reads a metadata file, deserializes it into a
  data structure in memory, or interprets a data structure of metadata
  elements.
  
  =item producer
  
  This refers to code that constructs a metadata data structure,
  serializes into a bytestream and/or writes it to disk.
  
  =item must, should, may, etc.
  
  These terms are interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 DATA TYPES
  
  Fields in the L</STRUCTURE> section describe data elements, each of
  which has an associated data type as described herein.  There are four
  primitive types: Boolean, String, List and Map.  Other types are
  subtypes of primitives and define compound data structures or define
  constraints on the values of a data element.
  
  =head2 Boolean
  
  A I<Boolean> is used to provide a true or false value.  It B<must> be
  represented as a defined value.
  
  =head2 String
  
  A I<String> is data element containing a non-zero length sequence of
  Unicode characters, such as an ordinary Perl scalar that is not a
  reference.
  
  =head2 List
  
  A I<List> is an ordered collection of zero or more data elements.
  Elements of a List may be of mixed types.
  
  Producers B<must> represent List elements using a data structure which
  unambiguously indicates that multiple values are possible, such as a
  reference to a Perl array (an "arrayref").
  
  Consumers expecting a List B<must> consider a String as equivalent to a
  List of length 1.
  
  =head2 Map
  
  A I<Map> is an unordered collection of zero or more data elements
  ("values"), indexed by associated String elements ("keys").  The Map's
  value elements may be of mixed types.
  
  =head2 License String
  
  A I<License String> is a subtype of String with a restricted set of
  values.  Valid values are described in detail in the description of
  the L</license> field.
  
  =head2 URL
  
  I<URL> is a subtype of String containing a Uniform Resource Locator or
  Identifier.  [ This type is called URL and not URI for historical reasons. ]
  
  =head2 Version
  
  A I<Version> is a subtype of String containing a value that describes
  the version number of packages or distributions.  Restrictions on format
  are described in detail in the L</Version Formats> section.
  
  =head2 Version Range
  
  The I<Version Range> type is a subtype of String.  It describes a range
  of Versions that may be present or installed to fulfill prerequisites.
  It is specified in detail in the L</Version Ranges> section.
  
  =head1 STRUCTURE
  
  The metadata structure is a data element of type Map.  This section
  describes valid keys within the Map.
  
  Any keys not described in this specification document (whether top-level
  or within compound data structures described herein) are considered
  I<custom keys> and B<must> begin with an "x" or "X" and be followed by an
  underscore; i.e. they must match the pattern: C<< qr{\Ax_}i >>.  If a
  custom key refers to a compound data structure, subkeys within it do not
  need an "x_" or "X_" prefix.
  
  Consumers of metadata may ignore any or all custom keys.  All other keys
  not described herein are invalid and should be ignored by consumers.
  Producers must not generate or output invalid keys.
  
  For each key, an example is provided followed by a description.  The
  description begins with the version of spec in which the key was added
  or in which the definition was modified, whether the key is I<required>
  or I<optional> and the data type of the corresponding data element.
  These items are in parentheses, brackets and braces, respectively.
  
  If a data type is a Map or Map subtype, valid subkeys will be described
  as well.
  
  Some fields are marked I<Deprecated>.  These are shown for historical
  context and must not be produced in or consumed from any metadata structure
  of version 2 or higher.
  
  =head2 REQUIRED FIELDS
  
  =head3 abstract
  
  Example:
  
    abstract => 'Build and install Perl modules'
  
  (Spec 1.2) [required] {String}
  
  This is a short description of the purpose of the distribution.
  
  =head3 author
  
  Example:
  
    author => [ 'Ken Williams <kwilliams@cpan.org>' ]
  
  (Spec 1.2) [required] {List of one or more Strings}
  
  This List indicates the person(s) to contact concerning the
  distribution. The preferred form of the contact string is:
  
    contact-name <email-address>
  
  This field provides a general contact list independent of other
  structured fields provided within the L</resources> field, such as
  C<bugtracker>.  The addressee(s) can be contacted for any purpose
  including but not limited to (security) problems with the distribution,
  questions about the distribution or bugs in the distribution.
  
  A distribution's original author is usually the contact listed within
  this field.  Co-maintainers, successor maintainers or mailing lists
  devoted to the distribution may also be listed in addition to or instead
  of the original author.
  
  =head3 dynamic_config
  
  Example:
  
    dynamic_config => 1
  
  (Spec 2) [required] {Boolean}
  
  A boolean flag indicating whether a F<Build.PL> or F<Makefile.PL> (or
  similar) must be executed to determine prerequisites.
  
  This field should be set to a true value if the distribution performs
  some dynamic configuration (asking questions, sensing the environment,
  etc.) as part of its configuration.  This field should be set to a false
  value to indicate that prerequisites included in metadata may be
  considered final and valid for static analysis.
  
  Note: when this field is true, post-configuration prerequisites are not
  guaranteed to bear any relation whatsoever to those stated in the metadata,
  and relying on them doing so is an error. See also
  L</Prerequisites for dynamically configured distributions> in the implementors'
  notes.
  
  This field explicitly B<does not> indicate whether installation may be
  safely performed without using a Makefile or Build file, as there may be
  special files to install or custom installation targets (e.g. for
  dual-life modules that exist on CPAN as well as in the Perl core).  This
  field only defines whether or not prerequisites are exactly as given in the
  metadata.
  
  =head3 generated_by
  
  Example:
  
    generated_by => 'Module::Build version 0.36'
  
  (Spec 1.0) [required] {String}
  
  This field indicates the tool that was used to create this metadata.
  There are no defined semantics for this field, but it is traditional to
  use a string in the form "Generating::Package version 1.23" or the
  author's name, if the file was generated by hand.
  
  =head3 license
  
  Example:
  
    license => [ 'perl_5' ]
  
    license => [ 'apache_2_0', 'mozilla_1_0' ]
  
  (Spec 2) [required] {List of one or more License Strings}
  
  One or more licenses that apply to some or all of the files in the
  distribution.  If multiple licenses are listed, the distribution
  documentation should be consulted to clarify the interpretation of
  multiple licenses.
  
  The following list of license strings are valid:
  
   string          description

   sun             Sun Internet Standards Source License (SISSL)
   zlib            zlib License
  
  The following license strings are also valid and indicate other
  licensing not described above:
  
   string          description
   -------------   -----------------------------------------------
   open_source     Other Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license
   restricted      Requires special permission from copyright holder
   unrestricted    Not an OSI approved license, but not restricted
   unknown         License not provided in metadata
  
  All other strings are invalid in the license field.
  
  =head3 meta-spec
  
  Example:
  
    'meta-spec' => {
      version => '2',
      url     => 'http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Meta::Spec',
    }
  
  (Spec 1.2) [required] {Map}
  
  This field indicates the version of the CPAN Meta Spec that should be
  used to interpret the metadata.  Consumers must check this key as soon
  as possible and abort further metadata processing if the meta-spec
  version is not supported by the consumer.
  
  The following keys are valid, but only C<version> is required.
  
  =over
  
  =item version
  
  This subkey gives the integer I<Version> of the CPAN Meta Spec against
  which the document was generated.
  
  =item url
  
  This is a I<URL> of the metadata specification document corresponding to
  the given version.  This is strictly for human-consumption and should
  not impact the interpretation of the document.
  
  For the version 2 spec, either of these are recommended:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec>
  
  =item *
  
  C<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?CPAN::Meta::Spec>
  
  =back
  
  =back
  
  =head3 name
  
  Example:
  
    name => 'Module-Build'
  
  (Spec 1.0) [required] {String}
  
  This field is the name of the distribution.  This is often created by
  taking the "main package" in the distribution and changing C<::> to
  C<->, but the name may be completely unrelated to the packages within
  the distribution.  For example, L<LWP::UserAgent> is distributed as part
  of the distribution name "libwww-perl".
  
  =head3 release_status
  
  Example:
  
    release_status => 'stable'
  
  (Spec 2) [required] {String}
  
  This field provides the  release status of this distribution.  If the
  C<version> field contains an underscore character, then
  C<release_status> B<must not> be "stable."
  
  The C<release_status> field B<must> have one of the following values:
  
  =over
  
  =item stable
  
  This indicates an ordinary, "final" release that should be indexed by PAUSE
  or other indexers.
  
  =item testing
  
  This indicates a "beta" release that is substantially complete, but has an
  elevated risk of bugs and requires additional testing.  The distribution
  should not be installed over a stable release without an explicit request
  or other confirmation from a user.  This release status may also be used
  for "release candidate" versions of a distribution.
  
  =item unstable
  
  This indicates an "alpha" release that is under active development, but has
  been released for early feedback or testing and may be missing features or
  may have serious bugs.  The distribution should not be installed over a
  stable release without an explicit request or other confirmation from a
  user.
  
  =back
  
  Consumers B<may> use this field to determine how to index the
  distribution for CPAN or other repositories in addition to or in
  replacement of heuristics based on version number or file name.
  
  =head3 version
  
  Example:
  
    version => '0.36'
  
  (Spec 1.0) [required] {Version}
  
  This field gives the version of the distribution to which the metadata
  structure refers.
  
  =head2 OPTIONAL FIELDS
  
  =head3 description
  
  Example:
  
      description =>  "Module::Build is a system for "
        . "building, testing, and installing Perl modules. "
        . "It is meant to ... blah blah blah ...",
  
  (Spec 2) [optional] {String}
  
  A longer, more complete description of the purpose or intended use of
  the distribution than the one provided by the C<abstract> key.
  
  =head3 keywords
  
  Example:
  
    keywords => [ qw/ toolchain cpan dual-life / ]
  
  (Spec 1.1) [optional] {List of zero or more Strings}
  
  A List of keywords that describe this distribution.  Keywords
  B<must not> include whitespace.
  
  =head3 no_index
  
  Example:
  
    no_index => {
      file      => [ 'My/Module.pm' ],
      directory => [ 'My/Private' ],
      package   => [ 'My::Module::Secret' ],
      namespace => [ 'My::Module::Sample' ],
    }
  
  (Spec 1.2) [optional] {Map}
  
  This Map describes any files, directories, packages, and namespaces that
  are private to the packaging or implementation of the distribution and
  should be ignored by indexing or search tools. Note that this is a list of
  exclusions, and the spec does not define what to I<include> - see
  L</Indexing distributions a la PAUSE> in the implementors notes for more
  information.
  
  Valid subkeys are as follows:
  
  =over
  
  =item file
  
  A I<List> of relative paths to files.  Paths B<must be> specified with
  unix conventions.
  
  =item directory
  
  A I<List> of relative paths to directories.  Paths B<must be> specified
  with unix conventions.
  
  [ Note: previous editions of the spec had C<dir> instead of C<directory> ]
  
  =item package
  
  A I<List> of package names.
  
  =item namespace
  
  A I<List> of package namespaces, where anything below the namespace
  must be ignored, but I<not> the namespace itself.
  
  In the example above for C<no_index>, C<My::Module::Sample::Foo> would
  be ignored, but C<My::Module::Sample> would not.
  
  =back
  
  =head3 optional_features
  
  Example:
  
    optional_features => {
      sqlite => {
        description => 'Provides SQLite support',
        prereqs => {
          runtime => {
            requires => {
              'DBD::SQLite' => '1.25'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  
  (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}
  
  This Map describes optional features with incremental prerequisites.
  Each key of the C<optional_features> Map is a String used to identify
  the feature and each value is a Map with additional information about
  the feature.  Valid subkeys include:
  
  =over
  
  =item description
  
  This is a String describing the feature.  Every optional feature
  should provide a description
  
  =item prereqs
  
  This entry is required and has the same structure as that of the
  C<L</prereqs>> key.  It provides a list of package requirements
  that must be satisfied for the feature to be supported or enabled.
  
  There is one crucial restriction:  the prereqs of an optional feature
  B<must not> include C<configure> phase prereqs.
  
  =back
  
  Consumers B<must not> include optional features as prerequisites without
  explicit instruction from users (whether via interactive prompting,
  a function parameter or a configuration value, etc. ).
  
  If an optional feature is used by a consumer to add additional
  prerequisites, the consumer should merge the optional feature
  prerequisites into those given by the C<prereqs> key using the same
  semantics.  See L</Merging and Resolving Prerequisites> for details on
  merging prerequisites.
  
  I<Suggestion for disuse:> Because there is currently no way for a
  distribution to specify a dependency on an optional feature of another
  dependency, the use of C<optional_feature> is discouraged.  Instead,
  create a separate, installable distribution that ensures the desired
  feature is available.  For example, if C<Foo::Bar> has a C<Baz> feature,
  release a separate C<Foo-Bar-Baz> distribution that satisfies
  requirements for the feature.
  
  =head3 prereqs
  
  Example:
  
    prereqs => {
      runtime => {
        requires => {
          'perl'          => '5.006',
          'File::Spec'    => '0.86',
          'JSON'          => '2.16',
        },
        recommends => {
          'JSON::XS'      => '2.26',
        },
        suggests => {
          'Archive::Tar'  => '0',
        },
      },
      build => {
        requires => {
          'Alien::SDL'    => '1.00',
        },
      },
      test => {
        recommends => {
          'Test::Deep'    => '0.10',
        },
      }
    }
  
  (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}
  
  This is a Map that describes all the prerequisites of the distribution.
  The keys are phases of activity, such as C<configure>, C<build>, C<test>
  or C<runtime>.  Values are Maps in which the keys name the type of
  prerequisite relationship such as C<requires>, C<recommends>, or
  C<suggests> and the value provides a set of prerequisite relations.  The
  set of relations B<must> be specified as a Map of package names to
  version ranges.
  
  The full definition for this field is given in the L</Prereq Spec>
  section.
  
  =head3 provides
  
  Example:
  
    provides => {
      'Foo::Bar' => {
        file    => 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm',
        version => '0.27_02',
      },
      'Foo::Bar::Blah' => {
        file    => 'lib/Foo/Bar/Blah.pm',
      },
      'Foo::Bar::Baz' => {
        file    => 'lib/Foo/Bar/Baz.pm',
        version => '0.3',
      },
    }
  
  (Spec 1.2) [optional] {Map}
  
  This describes all packages provided by this distribution.  This
  information is used by distribution and automation mechanisms like
  PAUSE, CPAN, metacpan.org and search.cpan.org to build indexes saying in
  which distribution various packages can be found.
  
  The keys of C<provides> are package names that can be found within
  the distribution.  If a package name key is provided, it must
  have a Map with the following valid subkeys:
  
  =over
  
  =item file
  
  This field is required.  It must contain a Unix-style relative file path
  from the root of the distribution directory to a file that contains or
  generates the package.  It may be given as C<META.yml> or C<META.json>
  to claim a package for indexing without needing a C<*.pm>.
  
  =item version
  
  If it exists, this field must contains a I<Version> String for the
  package.  If the package does not have a C<$VERSION>, this field must
  be omitted.
  
  =back
  
  =head3 resources
  
  Example:
  
    resources => {
      license     => [ 'http://dev.perl.org/licenses/' ],
      homepage    => 'http://sourceforge.net/projects/module-build',
      bugtracker  => {
        web    => 'http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=CPAN-Meta',
        mailto => 'meta-bugs@example.com',
      },
      repository  => {
        url  => 'git://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta.git',
        web  => 'http://github.com/dagolden/cpan-meta',
        type => 'git',
      },
      x_twitter   => 'http://twitter.com/cpan_linked/',
    }
  
  (Spec 2) [optional] {Map}
  
  This field describes resources related to this distribution.
  
  Valid subkeys include:
  
  =over
  
  =item homepage
  
  The official home of this project on the web.
  
  =item license
  
  A List of I<URL>'s that relate to this distribution's license.  As with the
  top-level C<license> field, distribution documentation should be consulted
  to clarify the interpretation of multiple licenses provided here.
  
  =item bugtracker
  
  This entry describes the bug tracking system for this distribution.  It
  is a Map with the following valid keys:
  
    web    - a URL pointing to a web front-end for the bug tracker
    mailto - an email address to which bugs can be sent
  
  =item repository
  
  This entry describes the source control repository for this distribution.  It
  is a Map with the following valid keys:
  
    url  - a URL pointing to the repository itself
    web  - a URL pointing to a web front-end for the repository
    type - a lowercase string indicating the VCS used
  
  Because a url like C<http://myrepo.example.com/> is ambiguous as to
  type, producers should provide a C<type> whenever a C<url> key is given.
  The C<type> field should be the name of the most common program used
  to work with the repository, e.g. C<git>, C<svn>, C<cvs>, C<darcs>,
  C<bzr> or C<hg>.

  =head1 VERSION NUMBERS
  
  =head2 Version Formats
  
  This section defines the Version type, used by several fields in the
  CPAN Meta Spec.
  
  Version numbers must be treated as strings, not numbers.  For
  example, C<1.200> B<must not> be serialized as C<1.2>.  Version
  comparison should be delegated to the Perl L<version> module, version
  0.80 or newer.
  
  Unless otherwise specified, version numbers B<must> appear in one of two
  formats:
  
  =over
  
  =item Decimal versions
  
  Decimal versions are regular "decimal numbers", with some limitations.
  They B<must> be non-negative and B<must> begin and end with a digit.  A
  single underscore B<may> be included, but B<must> be between two digits.
  They B<must not> use exponential notation ("1.23e-2").
  
     version => '1.234'       # OK
     version => '1.23_04'     # OK
  
     version => '1.23_04_05'  # Illegal
     version => '1.'          # Illegal
     version => '.1'          # Illegal
  
  =item Dotted-integer versions
  
  Dotted-integer (also known as dotted-decimal) versions consist of
  positive integers separated by full stop characters (i.e. "dots",
  "periods" or "decimal points").  This are equivalent in format to Perl
  "v-strings", with some additional restrictions on form.  They must be
  given in "normal" form, which has a leading "v" character and at least
  three integer components.  To retain a one-to-one mapping with decimal
  versions, all components after the first B<should> be restricted to the
  range 0 to 999.  The final component B<may> be separated by an
  underscore character instead of a period.
  
     version => 'v1.2.3'      # OK
     version => 'v1.2_3'      # OK
     version => 'v1.2.3.4'    # OK
     version => 'v1.2.3_4'    # OK
     version => 'v2009.10.31' # OK
  
     version => 'v1.2'          # Illegal
     version => '1.2.3'         # Illegal
     version => 'v1.2_3_4'      # Illegal
     version => 'v1.2009.10.31' # Not recommended
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Version Ranges
  
  Some fields (prereq, optional_features) indicate the particular
  version(s) of some other module that may be required as a prerequisite.
  This section details the Version Range type used to provide this
  information.
  
  The simplest format for a Version Range is just the version
  number itself, e.g. C<2.4>.  This means that B<at least> version 2.4
  must be present.  To indicate that B<any> version of a prerequisite is
  okay, even if the prerequisite doesn't define a version at all, use
  the version C<0>.
  
  Alternatively, a version range B<may> use the operators E<lt> (less than),
  E<lt>= (less than or equal), E<gt> (greater than), E<gt>= (greater than
  or equal), == (equal), and != (not equal).  For example, the
  specification C<E<lt> 2.0> means that any version of the prerequisite
  less than 2.0 is suitable.
  
  For more complicated situations, version specifications B<may> be AND-ed
  together using commas.  The specification C<E<gt>= 1.2, != 1.5, E<lt>
  2.0> indicates a version that must be B<at least> 1.2, B<less than> 2.0,
  and B<not equal to> 1.5.
  
  =head1 PREREQUISITES
  
  =head2 Prereq Spec
  
  The C<prereqs> key in the top-level metadata and within
  C<optional_features> define the relationship between a distribution and
  other packages.  The prereq spec structure is a hierarchical data
  structure which divides prerequisites into I<Phases> of activity in the
  installation process and I<Relationships> that indicate how
  prerequisites should be resolved.
  
  For example, to specify that C<Data::Dumper> is C<required> during the
  C<test> phase, this entry would appear in the distribution metadata:
  
    prereqs => {
      test => {
        requires => {
          'Data::Dumper' => '2.00'
        }
      }
    }
  
  =head3 Phases
  
  Requirements for regular use must be listed in the C<runtime> phase.
  Other requirements should be listed in the earliest stage in which they
  are required and consumers must accumulate and satisfy requirements
  across phases before executing the activity. For example, C<build>
  requirements must also be available during the C<test> phase.
  
    before action       requirements that must be met
    ----------------    --------------------------------
    perl Build.PL       configure
    perl Makefile.PL
  
    make                configure, runtime, build
    Build
  
    make test           configure, runtime, build, test
    Build test
  
  Consumers that install the distribution must ensure that
  I<runtime> requirements are also installed and may install
  dependencies from other phases.
  
    after action        requirements that must be met
    ----------------    --------------------------------
    make install        runtime
    Build install
  
  =over
  
  =item configure
  
  The configure phase occurs before any dynamic configuration has been
  attempted.  Libraries required by the configure phase B<must> be
  available for use before the distribution building tool has been
  executed.
  
  =item build
  
  The build phase is when the distribution's source code is compiled (if
  necessary) and otherwise made ready for installation.
  
  =item test
  
  The test phase is when the distribution's automated test suite is run.
  Any library that is needed only for testing and not for subsequent use
  should be listed here.
  
  =item runtime
  
  The runtime phase refers not only to when the distribution's contents
  are installed, but also to its continued use.  Any library that is a
  prerequisite for regular use of this distribution should be indicated
  here.
  
  =item develop
  
  The develop phase's prereqs are libraries needed to work on the
  distribution's source code as its author does.  These tools might be
  needed to build a release tarball, to run author-only tests, or to
  perform other tasks related to developing new versions of the
  distribution.
  
  =back
  
  =head3 Relationships
  
  =over
  
  =item requires
  
  These dependencies B<must> be installed for proper completion of the
  phase.
  
  =item recommends
  
  Recommended dependencies are I<strongly> encouraged and should be
  satisfied except in resource constrained environments.
  
  =item suggests
  
  These dependencies are optional, but are suggested for enhanced operation
  of the described distribution.
  
  =item conflicts
  
  These libraries cannot be installed when the phase is in operation.
  This is a very rare situation, and the C<conflicts> relationship should
  be used with great caution, or not at all.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Merging and Resolving Prerequisites
  
  Whenever metadata consumers merge prerequisites, either from different
  phases or from C<optional_features>, they should merged in a way which
  preserves the intended semantics of the prerequisite structure.  Generally,
  this means concatenating the version specifications using commas, as
  described in the L<Version Ranges> section.
  
  Another subtle error that can occur in resolving prerequisites comes from
  the way that modules in prerequisites are indexed to distribution files on
  CPAN.  When a module is deleted from a distribution, prerequisites calling
  for that module could indicate an older distribution should be installed,
  potentially overwriting files from a newer distribution.
  
  For example, as of Oct 31, 2009, the CPAN index file contained these
  module-distribution mappings:
  
    Class::MOP                   0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz
    Class::MOP::Class            0.94  D/DR/DROLSKY/Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz
    Class::MOP::Class::Immutable 0.04  S/ST/STEVAN/Class-MOP-0.36.tar.gz
  
  Consider the case where "Class::MOP" 0.94 is installed.  If a
  distribution specified "Class::MOP::Class::Immutable" as a prerequisite,
  it could result in Class-MOP-0.36.tar.gz being installed, overwriting
  any files from Class-MOP-0.94.tar.gz.
  
  Consumers of metadata B<should> test whether prerequisites would result
  in installed module files being "downgraded" to an older version and
  B<may> warn users or ignore the prerequisite that would cause such a
  result.
  
  =head1 SERIALIZATION
  
  Distribution metadata should be serialized (as a hashref) as
  JSON-encoded data and packaged with distributions as the file
  F<META.json>.
  
  In the past, the distribution metadata structure had been packed with
  distributions as F<META.yml>, a file in the YAML Tiny format (for which,
  see L<YAML::Tiny>).  Tools that consume distribution metadata from disk
  should be capable of loading F<META.yml>, but should prefer F<META.json>
  if both are found.
  
  =head1 NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTORS
  
  =head2 Extracting Version Numbers from Perl Modules
  
  To get the version number from a Perl module, consumers should use the
  C<< MM->parse_version($file) >> method provided by
  L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> or L<Module::Metadata>.  For example, for the
  module given by C<$mod>, the version may be retrieved in one of the
  following ways:
  
    # via ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    my $file = MM->_installed_file_for_module($mod);
    my $version = MM->parse_version($file)
  
  The private C<_installed_file_for_module> method may be replaced with
  other methods for locating a module in C<@INC>.
  
    # via Module::Metadata
    my $info = Module::Metadata->new_from_module($mod);
    my $version = $info->version;
  
  If only a filename is available, the following approach may be used:
  
    # via Module::Build
    my $info = Module::Metadata->new_from_file($file);
    my $version = $info->version;
  
  =head2 Comparing Version Numbers
  
  The L<version> module provides the most reliable way to compare version
  numbers in all the various ways they might be provided or might exist
  within modules.  Given two strings containing version numbers, C<$v1> and
  C<$v2>, they should be converted to C<version> objects before using
  ordinary comparison operators.  For example:
  
    use version;
    if ( version->new($v1) <=> version->new($v2) ) {
      print "Versions are not equal\n";
    }
  
  If the only comparison needed is whether an installed module is of a
  sufficiently high version, a direct test may be done using the string
  form of C<eval> and the C<use> function.  For example, for module C<$mod>
  and version prerequisite C<$prereq>:
  
    if ( eval "use $mod $prereq (); 1" ) {
      print "Module $mod version is OK.\n";
    }
  
  If the values of C<$mod> and C<$prereq> have not been scrubbed, however,
  this presents security implications.
  
  =head2 Prerequisites for dynamically configured distributions
  
  When C<dynamic_config> is true, it is an error to presume that the
  prerequisites given in distribution metadata will have any relationship
  whatsoever to the actual prerequisites of the distribution.
  
  In practice, however, one can generally expect such prerequisites to be
  one of two things:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  The minimum prerequisites for the distribution, to which dynamic configuration will only add items
  
  =item *
  
  Whatever the distribution configured with on the releaser's machine at release time
  
  =back
  
  The second case often turns out to have identical results to the first case,
  albeit only by accident.
  
  As such, consumers may use this data for informational analysis, but
  presenting it to the user as canonical or relying on it as such is
  invariably the height of folly.
  
  =head2 Indexing distributions a la PAUSE
  
  While no_index tells you what must be ignored when indexing, this spec holds
  no opinion on how you should get your initial candidate list of things to
  possibly index. For "normal" distributions you might consider simply indexing
  the contents of lib/, but there are many fascinating oddities on CPAN and
  many dists from the days when it was normal to put the main .pm file in the
  root of the distribution archive - so PAUSE currently indexes all .pm and .PL
  files that are not either (a) specifically excluded by no_index (b) in
  C<inc>, C<xt>, or C<t> directories, or common 'mistake' directories such as
  C<perl5>.
  
  Or: If you're trying to be PAUSE-like, make sure you skip C<inc>, C<xt> and
  C<t> as well as anything marked as no_index.
  
  Also remember: If the META file contains a provides field, you shouldn't be
  indexing anything in the first place - just use that.

  =head1 HISTORY
  
  Ken Williams wrote the original CPAN Meta Spec (also known as the
  "META.yml spec") in 2003 and maintained it through several revisions
  with input from various members of the community.  In 2005, Randy
  Sims redrafted it from HTML to POD for the version 1.2 release.  Ken
  continued to maintain the spec through version 1.4.
  
  In late 2009, David Golden organized the version 2 proposal review
  process.  David and Ricardo Signes drafted the final version 2 spec
  in April 2010 based on the version 1.4 spec and patches contributed
  during the proposal process.

  =head1 NAME
  
  CPAN::Meta::Validator - validate CPAN distribution metadata structures
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 2.143240
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    my $struct = decode_json_file('META.json');
  
    my $cmv = CPAN::Meta::Validator->new( $struct );
  
    unless ( $cmv->is_valid ) {
      my $msg = "Invalid META structure.  Errors found:\n";
      $msg .= join( "\n", $cmv->errors );
      die $msg;
    }
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module validates a CPAN Meta structure against the version of the
  the specification claimed in the C<meta-spec> field of the structure.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 new
  
    my $cmv = CPAN::Meta::Validator->new( $struct )
  
  The constructor must be passed a metadata structure.
  
  =head2 is_valid
  
    if ( $cmv->is_valid ) {
      ...
    }
  
  Returns a boolean value indicating whether the metadata provided
  is valid.
  
  =head2 errors
  
    warn( join "\n", $cmv->errors );
  
  Returns a list of errors seen during validation.
  
  =begin :internals
  
  =head2 Check Methods
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  check_map($spec,$data)
  
  Checks whether a map (or hash) part of the data structure conforms to the
  appropriate specification definition.
  
  =item *
  
  check_list($spec,$data)
  
  Checks whether a list (or array) part of the data structure conforms to
  the appropriate specification definition.
  
  =item *
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Validator Methods
  
  =over
  
  =item *
  
  header($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that the header is valid.
  
  Note: No longer used as we now read the data structure, not the file.
  
  =item *
  
  url($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that a given value is in an acceptable URL format
  
  =item *
  
  urlspec($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that the URL to a META specification is a known one.
  
  =item *
  
  string_or_undef($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that the value is either a string or an undef value. Bit of a
  catchall function for parts of the data structure that are completely user
  defined.
  
  =item *
  
  string($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that a string exists for the given key.
  
  =item *
  
  file($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validate that a file is passed for the given key. This may be made more
  thorough in the future. For now it acts like \&string.
  
  =item *
  
  exversion($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates a list of versions, e.g. '<= 5, >=2, ==3, !=4, >1, <6, 0'.
  
  =item *
  
  version($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates a single version string. Versions of the type '5.8.8' and '0.00_00'
  are both valid. A leading 'v' like 'v1.2.3' is also valid.
  
  =item *
  
  boolean($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates for a boolean value. Currently these values are '1', '0', 'true',
  'false', however the latter 2 may be removed.
  
  =item *
  
  license($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that a value is given for the license. Returns 1 if an known license
  type, or 2 if a value is given but the license type is not a recommended one.
  
  =item *
  
  custom_1($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that the given key is in CamelCase, to indicate a user defined
  keyword and only has characters in the class [-_a-zA-Z].  In version 1.X
  of the spec, this was only explicitly stated for 'resources'.
  
  =item *
  
  custom_2($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that the given key begins with 'x_' or 'X_', to indicate a user
  defined keyword and only has characters in the class [-_a-zA-Z]
  
  =item *
  
  identifier($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that key is in an acceptable format for the META specification,
  for an identifier, i.e. any that matches the regular expression
  qr/[a-z][a-z_]/i.
  
  =item *
  
  module($self,$key,$value)
  
  Validates that a given key is in an acceptable module name format, e.g.
  'Test::CPAN::Meta::Version'.

  CPAN::Meta::YAML - Read and write a subset of YAML for CPAN Meta files
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.011
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use CPAN::Meta::YAML;
  
      # reading a META file
      open $fh, "<:utf8", "META.yml";
      $yaml_text = do { local $/; <$fh> };
      $yaml = CPAN::Meta::YAML->read_string($yaml_text)
        or die CPAN::Meta::YAML->errstr;

        or die CPAN::Meta::YAML->errstr;
      open $fh, ">:utf8", "META.yml";
      print $fh $yaml_text;
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module implements a subset of the YAML specification for use in reading
  and writing CPAN metadata files like F<META.yml> and F<MYMETA.yml>.  It should
  not be used for any other general YAML parsing or generation task.
  
  NOTE: F<META.yml> (and F<MYMETA.yml>) files should be UTF-8 encoded.  Users are
  responsible for proper encoding and decoding.  In particular, the C<read> and
  C<write> methods do B<not> support UTF-8 and should not be used.
  
  =head1 SUPPORT
  
  This module is currently derived from L<YAML::Tiny> by Adam Kennedy.  If
  there are bugs in how it parses a particular META.yml file, please file
  a bug report in the YAML::Tiny bugtracker:
  L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=YAML-Tiny>

  =head1 NAME
  
  Carton - Perl module dependency manager (aka Bundler for Perl)
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    # On your development environment
    > cat cpanfile
    requires 'Plack', '0.9980';
    requires 'Starman', '0.2000';
  
    > carton install
    > git add cpanfile cpanfile.snapshot
    > git commit -m "add Plack and Starman"
  
    # Other developer's machine, or on a deployment box
    > carton install
    > carton exec starman -p 8080 myapp.psgi
  
  =head1 AVAILABILITY
  
  Carton only works with perl installation with the complete set of core
  modules. If you use perl installed by a vendor package with modules
  stripped from core, Carton is not expected to work correctly.
  
  Also, Carton requires you to run your command/application with
  C<carton exec> command, which means it's difficult or impossible to
  run in an embedded perl use case such as mod_perl.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  carton is a command line tool to track the Perl module dependencies
  for your Perl application. Dependencies are declared using L<cpanfile>
  format, and the managed dependencies are tracked in a
  I<cpanfile.snapshot> file, which is meant to be version controlled,
  and the snapshot file allows other developers of your application will
  have the exact same versions of the modules.
  
  For C<cpanfile> syntax, see L<cpanfile> documentation.
  
  =head1 TUTORIAL
  
  =head2 Initializing the environment
  
  carton will use the I<local> directory to install modules into. You're
  recommended to exclude these directories from the version control
  system.
  
    > echo local/ >> .gitignore
    > git add cpanfile cpanfile.snapshot
    > git commit -m "Start using carton"
  
  =head2 Tracking the dependencies
  
  You can manage the dependencies of your application via C<cpanfile>.
  
    # cpanfile
    requires 'Plack', '0.9980';
    requires 'Starman', '0.2000';
  
  And then you can install these dependencies via:
  
    > carton install
  
  The modules are installed into your I<local> directory, and the
  dependencies tree and version information are analyzed and saved into
  I<cpanfile.snapshot> in your directory.
  
  Make sure you add I<cpanfile> and I<cpanfile.snapshot> to your version
  controlled repository and commit changes as you update
  dependencies. This will ensure that other developers on your app, as
  well as your deployment environment, use exactly the same versions of
  the modules you just installed.
  
    > git add cpanfile cpanfile.snapshot
    > git commit -m "Added Plack and Starman"
  
  =head2 Deploying your application
  
  Once you've done installing all the dependencies, you can push your
  application directory to a remote machine (excluding I<local> and
  I<.carton>) and run the following command:
  
    > carton install --deployment
  
  This will look at the I<cpanfile.snapshot> and install the exact same
  versions of the dependencies into I<local>, and now your application
  is ready to run.
  
  The C<--deployment> flag makes sure that carton will only install
  modules and versions available in your snapshot, and won't fallback to
  query for CPAN Meta DB for missing modules.
  
  =head2 Bundling modules
  
  carton can bundle all the tarballs for your dependencies into a
  directory so that you can even install dependencies that are not
  available on CPAN, such as internal distribution aka DarkPAN.
  
    > carton bundle
  
  will bundle these tarballs into I<vendor/cache> directory, and
  
    > carton install --cached
  
  will install modules using this local cache. Combined with
  C<--deployment> option, you can avoid querying for a database like
  CPAN Meta DB or downloading files from CPAN mirrors upon deployment
  time.
  
  =head1 PERL VERSIONS
  
  When you take a snapshot in one perl version and deploy on another
  (different) version, you might have troubles with core modules.
  
  The simplest solution, which might not work for everybody, is to use
  the same version of perl in the development and deployment.
  
  To enforce that, you're recommended to use L<plenv> and
  C<.perl-version> to lock perl versions in development.
  
  You can also specify the minimum perl required in C<cpanfile>:
  
    requires 'perl', '5.16.3';
  
  and carton (and cpanm) will give you errors when deployed on hosts
  with perl lower than the specified version.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module offers a minimalist class construction kit in around 120 lines of
  code.  Here is a list of features:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  defines attributes via import arguments
  
  =item *
  
  generates read-write accessors
  
  =item *
  
  supports lazy attribute defaults
  
  =item *
  
  supports custom accessors
  
  =item *
  
  superclass provides a standard C<new> constructor
  
  =item *
  
  C<new> takes a hash reference or list of key/value pairs
  
  =item *
  
  C<new> supports providing C<BUILDARGS> to customize constructor options
  
  =item *
  
  C<new> calls C<BUILD> for each class from parent to child
  
  =item *
  
  superclass provides a C<DESTROY> method
  
  =item *
  
  C<DESTROY> calls C<DEMOLISH> for each class from child to parent
  
  =back
  
  Multiple-inheritance is possible, with superclass order determined via
  L<mro::get_linear_isa|mro/Functions>.
  
  It uses no non-core modules for any recent Perl. On Perls older than v5.10 it
  requires L<MRO::Compat>. On Perls older than v5.14, it requires
  L<Devel::GlobalDestruction>.
  
  =head1 USAGE
  
  =head2 Defining attributes
  
  Define attributes as a list of import arguments:
  
      package Foo::Bar;
  
      use Class::Tiny qw(
          name
          id
          height
          weight
      );
  
  For each attribute, a read-write accessor is created unless a subroutine of that
  name already exists:
  
      $obj->name;               # getter
      $obj->name( "John Doe" ); # setter
  
  Attribute names must be valid subroutine identifiers or an exception will
  be thrown.
  
  You can specify lazy defaults by defining attributes with a hash reference.
  Keys define attribute names and values are constants or code references that
  will be evaluated when the attribute is first accessed if no value has been
  set.  The object is passed as an argument to a code reference.
  
      package Foo::WithDefaults;
  
      use Class::Tiny qw/name id/, {
          title     => 'Peon',
          skills    => sub { [] },
          hire_date => sub { $_[0]->_build_hire_date },
      };
  
  When subclassing, if multiple accessors of the same name exist in different
  classes, any default (or lack of default) is determined by standard
  method resolution order.
  
  To make your own custom accessors, just pre-declare the method name before
  loading Class::Tiny:
  
      package Foo::Bar;
  
      use subs 'id';
  
      use Class::Tiny qw( name id );
  
      sub id { ... }
  
  Even if you pre-declare a method name, you must include it in the attribute
  list for Class::Tiny to register it as a valid attribute.
  
  If you set a default for a custom accessor, your accessor will need to retrieve
  the default and do something with it:
  
      package Foo::Bar;
  
      use subs 'id';
  
      use Class::Tiny qw( name ), { id => sub { int(rand(2*31)) } };
  
      sub id {
          my $self = shift;
          if (@_) {
              return $self->{id} = shift;
          }
          elsif ( exists $self->{id} ) {
              return $self->{id};
          }
          else {
              my $defaults =
                  Class::Tiny->get_all_attribute_defaults_for( ref $self );
              return $self->{id} = $defaults->{id}->();
          }
      }
  
  =head2 Class::Tiny::Object is your base class
  
  If your class B<does not> already inherit from some class, then
  Class::Tiny::Object will be added to your C<@ISA> to provide C<new> and
  C<DESTROY>.
  
  If your class B<does> inherit from something, then no additional inheritance is
  set up.  If the parent subclasses Class::Tiny::Object, then all is well.  If
  not, then you'll get accessors set up but no constructor or destructor. Don't
  do that unless you really have a special need for it.
  
  Define subclasses as normal.  It's best to define them with L<base>, L<parent>
  or L<superclass> before defining attributes with Class::Tiny so the C<@ISA>
  array is already populated at compile-time:
  
      package Foo::Bar::More;
  
      use parent 'Foo::Bar';
  
      use Class::Tiny qw( shoe_size );
  
  =head2 Object construction
  
  If your class inherits from Class::Tiny::Object (as it should if you followed
  the advice above), it provides the C<new> constructor for you.
  
  Objects can be created with attributes given as a hash reference or as a list
  of key/value pairs:
  
      $obj = Foo::Bar->new( name => "David" );
  
      $obj = Foo::Bar->new( { name => "David" } );
  
  If a reference is passed as a single argument, it must be able to be
  dereferenced as a hash or an exception is thrown.
  
  Unknown attributes in the constructor arguments will be ignored.  Prior to
  version 1.000, unknown attributes were an error, but this made it harder for
  people to cleanly subclass Class::Tiny classes so this feature was removed.
  
  You can define a C<BUILDARGS> method to change how arguments to new are
  handled.  It will receive the constructor arguments as they were provided and
  must return a hash reference of key/value pairs (or else throw an
  exception).
  
      sub BUILDARGS {
         my $class = shift;
         my $name = shift || "John Doe";
         return { name => $name };
       };
  
       Foo::Bar->new( "David" );
       Foo::Bar->new(); # "John Doe"
  
  Unknown attributes returned from C<BUILDARGS> will be ignored.
  
  =head2 BUILD
  
  If your class or any superclass defines a C<BUILD> method, it will be called
  by the constructor from the furthest parent class down to the child class after
  the object has been created.
  
  It is passed the constructor arguments as a hash reference.  The return value
  is ignored.  Use C<BUILD> for validation, checking required attributes or
  setting default values that depend on other attributes.
  
      sub BUILD {
          my ($self, $args) = @_;
  
          for my $req ( qw/name age/ ) {
              croak "$req attribute required" unless defined $self->$req;
          }
  
          croak "Age must be non-negative" if $self->age < 0;
  
          $self->msg( "Hello " . $self->name );
      }
  
  The argument reference is a copy, so deleting elements won't affect data in the
  original (but changes will be passed to other BUILD methods in C<@ISA>).
  
  =head2 DEMOLISH
  
  Class::Tiny provides a C<DESTROY> method.  If your class or any superclass
  defines a C<DEMOLISH> method, they will be called from the child class to the
  furthest parent class during object destruction.  It is provided a single
  boolean argument indicating whether Perl is in global destruction.  Return
  values and errors are ignored.
  
      sub DEMOLISH {
          my ($self, $global_destruct) = @_;
          $self->cleanup();
      }
  
  =head2 Introspection and internals
  
  You can retrieve an unsorted list of valid attributes known to Class::Tiny
  for a class and its superclasses with the C<get_all_attributes_for> class
  method.
  
      my @attrs = Class::Tiny->get_all_attributes_for("Employee");
      # returns qw/name ssn timestamp/
  
  Likewise, a hash reference of all valid attributes and default values (or code
  references) may be retrieved with the C<get_all_attribute_defaults_for> class
  method.  Any attributes without a default will be C<undef>.
  
      my $def = Class::Tiny->get_all_attribute_defaults_for("Employee");
      # returns {
      #   name => undef,
      #   ssn => undef
      #   timestamp => $coderef
      # }
  
  The C<import> method uses two class methods, C<prepare_class> and
  C<create_attributes> to set up the C<@ISA> array and attributes.  Anyone
  attempting to extend Class::Tiny itself should use these instead of mocking up
  a call to C<import>.
  
  When the first object is created, linearized C<@ISA>, the valid attribute list
  and various subroutine references are cached for speed.  Ensure that all
  inheritance and methods are in place before creating objects. (You don't want
  to be changing that once you create objects anyway, right?)

  =head1 RATIONALE
  
  =head2 Why this instead of Object::Tiny or Class::Accessor or something else?
  
  I wanted something so simple that it could potentially be used by core Perl
  modules I help maintain (or hope to write), most of which either use
  L<Class::Struct> or roll-their-own OO framework each time.
  
  L<Object::Tiny> and L<Object::Tiny::RW> were close to what I wanted, but
  lacking some features I deemed necessary, and their maintainers have an even
  more strict philosophy against feature creep than I have.
  
  I also considered L<Class::Accessor>, which has been around a long time and is
  heavily used, but it, too, lacked features I wanted and did things in ways I
  considered poor design.
  
  I looked for something else on CPAN, but after checking a dozen class creators
  I realized I could implement exactly what I wanted faster than I could search
  CPAN for something merely sufficient.
  
  In general, compared to most things on CPAN (other than Object::Tiny),
  Class::Tiny is smaller in implementation and simpler in API.
  
  Specifically, here is how Class::Tiny ("C::T") compares to Object::Tiny
  ("O::T") and Class::Accessor ("C::A"):

   provides DESTROY                   yes     no        no
   new takes either hashref or list   yes     no (list) no (hash)
   Moo(se)-like BUILD/DEMOLISH        yes     no        no
   Moo(se)-like BUILDARGS             yes     no        no
   no extraneous methods via @ISA     yes     yes       no
  
  =head2 Why this instead of Moose or Moo?
  
  L<Moose> and L<Moo> are both excellent OO frameworks.  Moose offers a powerful
  meta-object protocol (MOP), but is slow to start up and has about 30 non-core
  dependencies including XS modules.  Moo is faster to start up and has about 10
  pure Perl dependencies but provides no true MOP, relying instead on its ability
  to transparently upgrade Moo to Moose when Moose's full feature set is
  required.
  
  By contrast, Class::Tiny has no MOP and has B<zero> non-core dependencies for
  Perls in the L<support window|perlpolicy>.  It has far less code, less
  complexity and no learning curve. If you don't need or can't afford what Moo or
  Moose offer, this is intended to be a reasonable fallback.
  
  That said, Class::Tiny offers Moose-like conventions for things like C<BUILD>
  and C<DEMOLISH> for some minimal interoperability and an easier upgrade path.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Devel::GlobalDestruction - Provides function returning the equivalent of
  C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE} eq 'DESTRUCT'> for older perls.
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      package Foo;
      use Devel::GlobalDestruction;
  
      use namespace::clean; # to avoid having an "in_global_destruction" method
  
      sub DESTROY {
          return if in_global_destruction;
  
          do_something_a_little_tricky();
      }
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Perl's global destruction is a little tricky to deal with WRT finalizers
  because it's not ordered and objects can sometimes disappear.
  
  Writing defensive destructors is hard and annoying, and usually if global
  destruction is happening you only need the destructors that free up non
  process local resources to actually execute.
  
  For these constructors you can avoid the mess by simply bailing out if global
  destruction is in effect.
  
  =head1 EXPORTS
  
  This module uses L<Sub::Exporter::Progressive> so the exports may be renamed,
  aliased, etc. if L<Sub::Exporter> is present.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item in_global_destruction
  
  Returns true if the interpreter is in global destruction. In perl 5.14+, this
  returns C<${^GLOBAL_PHASE} eq 'DESTRUCT'>, and on earlier perls, detects it using
  the value of C<PL_main_cv> or C<PL_dirty>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  ExtUtils::Command - utilities to replace common UNIX commands in Makefiles etc.
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e cat files... > destination
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e mv source... destination
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e cp source... destination
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e touch files...
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e rm_f files...
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e rm_rf directories...
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e mkpath directories...
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e eqtime source destination
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e test_f file
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e test_d directory
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e chmod mode files...
    ...
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  The module is used to replace common UNIX commands.  In all cases the
  functions work from @ARGV rather than taking arguments.  This makes
  them easier to deal with in Makefiles.  Call them like this:
  
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e some_command some files to work on
  
  and I<NOT> like this:
  
    perl -MExtUtils::Command -e 'some_command qw(some files to work on)'
  
  For that use L<Shell::Command>.
  
  Filenames with * and ? will be glob expanded.

  pod2man() is a function performing most of the duties of the pod2man
  program.  Its arguments are exactly the same as pod2man as of 5.8.0

  And the removal of:
  
      --verbose/-v
      --help/-h
  
  If no arguments are given to pod2man it will read from @ARGV.
  
  If Pod::Man is unavailable, this function will warn and return undef.

  =head1 NAME
  
  ExtUtils::Liblist - determine libraries to use and how to use them
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    require ExtUtils::Liblist;
  
    $MM->ext($potential_libs, $verbose, $need_names);
  
    # Usually you can get away with:
    ExtUtils::Liblist->ext($potential_libs, $verbose, $need_names)
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This utility takes a list of libraries in the form C<-llib1 -llib2
  -llib3> and returns lines suitable for inclusion in an extension
  Makefile.  Extra library paths may be included with the form
  C<-L/another/path> this will affect the searches for all subsequent
  libraries.
  
  It returns an array of four or five scalar values: EXTRALIBS,
  BSLOADLIBS, LDLOADLIBS, LD_RUN_PATH, and, optionally, a reference to
  the array of the filenames of actual libraries.  Some of these don't
  mean anything unless on Unix.  See the details about those platform
  specifics below.  The list of the filenames is returned only if
  $need_names argument is true.
  
  Dependent libraries can be linked in one of three ways:
  
  =over 2
  
  =item * For static extensions
  
  by the ld command when the perl binary is linked with the extension
  library. See EXTRALIBS below.
  
  =item * For dynamic extensions at build/link time
  
  by the ld command when the shared object is built/linked. See
  LDLOADLIBS below.
  
  =item * For dynamic extensions at load time
  
  by the DynaLoader when the shared object is loaded. See BSLOADLIBS
  below.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 EXTRALIBS
  
  List of libraries that need to be linked with when linking a perl
  binary which includes this extension. Only those libraries that
  actually exist are included.  These are written to a file and used
  when linking perl.
  
  =head2 LDLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH
  
  List of those libraries which can or must be linked into the shared
  library when created using ld. These may be static or dynamic
  libraries.  LD_RUN_PATH is a colon separated list of the directories
  in LDLOADLIBS. It is passed as an environment variable to the process
  that links the shared library.
  
  =head2 BSLOADLIBS
  
  List of those libraries that are needed but can be linked in
  dynamically at run time on this platform.  SunOS/Solaris does not need
  this because ld records the information (from LDLOADLIBS) into the
  object file.  This list is used to create a .bs (bootstrap) file.
  
  =head1 PORTABILITY
  
  This module deals with a lot of system dependencies and has quite a
  few architecture specific C<if>s in the code.
  
  =head2 VMS implementation
  
  The version of ext() which is executed under VMS differs from the
  Unix-OS/2 version in several respects:
  
  =over 2
  
  =item *
  
  Input library and path specifications are accepted with or without the
  C<-l> and C<-L> prefixes used by Unix linkers.  If neither prefix is
  present, a token is considered a directory to search if it is in fact
  a directory, and a library to search for otherwise.  Authors who wish
  their extensions to be portable to Unix or OS/2 should use the Unix
  prefixes, since the Unix-OS/2 version of ext() requires them.
  
  =item *
  
  Wherever possible, shareable images are preferred to object libraries,
  and object libraries to plain object files.  In accordance with VMS
  naming conventions, ext() looks for files named I<lib>shr and I<lib>rtl;
  it also looks for I<lib>lib and libI<lib> to accommodate Unix conventions
  used in some ported software.
  
  =item *
  
  For each library that is found, an appropriate directive for a linker options
  file is generated.  The return values are space-separated strings of
  these directives, rather than elements used on the linker command line.
  
  =item *
  
  LDLOADLIBS contains both the libraries found based on C<$potential_libs> and
  the CRTLs, if any, specified in Config.pm.  EXTRALIBS contains just those
  libraries found based on C<$potential_libs>.  BSLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH
  are always empty.
  
  =back
  
  In addition, an attempt is made to recognize several common Unix library
  names, and filter them out or convert them to their VMS equivalents, as
  appropriate.
  
  In general, the VMS version of ext() should properly handle input from
  extensions originally designed for a Unix or VMS environment.  If you
  encounter problems, or discover cases where the search could be improved,
  please let us know.
  
  =head2 Win32 implementation
  
  The version of ext() which is executed under Win32 differs from the
  Unix-OS/2 version in several respects:
  
  =over 2
  
  =item *
  
  If C<$potential_libs> is empty, the return value will be empty.
  Otherwise, the libraries specified by C<$Config{perllibs}> (see Config.pm)
  will be appended to the list of C<$potential_libs>.  The libraries
  will be searched for in the directories specified in C<$potential_libs>,
  C<$Config{libpth}>, and in C<$Config{installarchlib}/CORE>.
  For each library that is found,  a space-separated list of fully qualified
  library pathnames is generated.
  
  =item *
  
  Input library and path specifications are accepted with or without the
  C<-l> and C<-L> prefixes used by Unix linkers.
  
  An entry of the form C<-La:\foo> specifies the C<a:\foo> directory to look
  for the libraries that follow.
  
  An entry of the form C<-lfoo> specifies the library C<foo>, which may be
  spelled differently depending on what kind of compiler you are using.  If
  you are using GCC, it gets translated to C<libfoo.a>, but for other win32
  compilers, it becomes C<foo.lib>.  If no files are found by those translated
  names, one more attempt is made to find them using either C<foo.a> or
  C<libfoo.lib>, depending on whether GCC or some other win32 compiler is
  being used, respectively.
  
  If neither the C<-L> or C<-l> prefix is present in an entry, the entry is
  considered a directory to search if it is in fact a directory, and a
  library to search for otherwise.  The C<$Config{lib_ext}> suffix will
  be appended to any entries that are not directories and don't already have
  the suffix.
  
  Note that the C<-L> and C<-l> prefixes are B<not required>, but authors
  who wish their extensions to be portable to Unix or OS/2 should use the
  prefixes, since the Unix-OS/2 version of ext() requires them.
  
  =item *
  
  Entries cannot be plain object files, as many Win32 compilers will
  not handle object files in the place of libraries.
  
  =item *
  
  Entries in C<$potential_libs> beginning with a colon and followed by
  alphanumeric characters are treated as flags.  Unknown flags will be ignored.
  
  An entry that matches C</:nodefault/i> disables the appending of default
  libraries found in C<$Config{perllibs}> (this should be only needed very rarely).
  
  An entry that matches C</:nosearch/i> disables all searching for
  the libraries specified after it.  Translation of C<-Lfoo> and
  C<-lfoo> still happens as appropriate (depending on compiler being used,
  as reflected by C<$Config{cc}>), but the entries are not verified to be
  valid files or directories.
  
  An entry that matches C</:search/i> reenables searching for
  the libraries specified after it.  You can put it at the end to
  enable searching for default libraries specified by C<$Config{perllibs}>.
  
  =item *
  
  The libraries specified may be a mixture of static libraries and
  import libraries (to link with DLLs).  Since both kinds are used
  pretty transparently on the Win32 platform, we do not attempt to
  distinguish between them.
  
  =item *
  
  LDLOADLIBS and EXTRALIBS are always identical under Win32, and BSLOADLIBS
  and LD_RUN_PATH are always empty (this may change in future).
  
  =item *
  
  You must make sure that any paths and path components are properly
  surrounded with double-quotes if they contain spaces. For example,
  C<$potential_libs> could be (literally):
  
  	"-Lc:\Program Files\vc\lib" msvcrt.lib "la test\foo bar.lib"
  
  Note how the first and last entries are protected by quotes in order
  to protect the spaces.
  
  =item *
  
  Since this module is most often used only indirectly from extension
  C<Makefile.PL> files, here is an example C<Makefile.PL> entry to add
  a library to the build process for an extension:
  
          LIBS => ['-lgl']
  
  When using GCC, that entry specifies that MakeMaker should first look
  for C<libgl.a> (followed by C<gl.a>) in all the locations specified by
  C<$Config{libpth}>.
  
  When using a compiler other than GCC, the above entry will search for
  C<gl.lib> (followed by C<libgl.lib>).
  
  If the library happens to be in a location not in C<$Config{libpth}>,
  you need:
  
          LIBS => ['-Lc:\gllibs -lgl']
  
  Here is a less often used example:
  
          LIBS => ['-lgl', ':nosearch -Ld:\mesalibs -lmesa -luser32']
  
  This specifies a search for library C<gl> as before.  If that search
  fails to find the library, it looks at the next item in the list. The
  C<:nosearch> flag will prevent searching for the libraries that follow,
  so it simply returns the value as C<-Ld:\mesalibs -lmesa -luser32>,
  since GCC can use that value as is with its linker.
  
  When using the Visual C compiler, the second item is returned as
  C<-libpath:d:\mesalibs mesa.lib user32.lib>.
  
  When using the Borland compiler, the second item is returned as
  C<-Ld:\mesalibs mesa.lib user32.lib>, and MakeMaker takes care of
  moving the C<-Ld:\mesalibs> to the correct place in the linker
  command line.

  ExtUtils::MM_Any - Platform-agnostic MM methods
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY!

    # Temporarily, you have to subclass both.  Put MM_Any first.
    require ExtUtils::MM_Any;

    @ISA = qw(ExtUtils::MM_Any ExtUtils::Unix);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  B<FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY!>
  
  ExtUtils::MM_Any is a superclass for the ExtUtils::MM_* set of
  modules.  It contains methods which are either inherently
  cross-platform or are written in a cross-platform manner.
  
  Subclass off of ExtUtils::MM_Any I<and> ExtUtils::MM_Unix.  This is a
  temporary solution.
  
  B<THIS MAY BE TEMPORARY!>
  
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  Any methods marked I<Abstract> must be implemented by subclasses.
  
  
  =head2 Cross-platform helper methods
  
  These are methods which help writing cross-platform code.
  
  
  
  =head3 os_flavor  I<Abstract>
  
      my @os_flavor = $mm->os_flavor;
  
  @os_flavor is the style of operating system this is, usually
  corresponding to the MM_*.pm file we're using.
  
  The first element of @os_flavor is the major family (ie. Unix,
  Windows, VMS, OS/2, etc...) and the rest are sub families.
  
  Some examples:
  
      Cygwin98       ('Unix',  'Cygwin', 'Cygwin9x')
      Windows        ('Win32')
      Win98          ('Win32', 'Win9x')
      Linux          ('Unix',  'Linux')
      MacOS X        ('Unix',  'Darwin', 'MacOS', 'MacOS X')
      OS/2           ('OS/2')
  
  This is used to write code for styles of operating system.
  See os_flavor_is() for use.
  
  
  =head3 os_flavor_is
  
      my $is_this_flavor = $mm->os_flavor_is($this_flavor);
      my $is_this_flavor = $mm->os_flavor_is(@one_of_these_flavors);
  
  Checks to see if the current operating system is one of the given flavors.
  
  This is useful for code like:
  
      if( $mm->os_flavor_is('Unix') ) {
          $out = `foo 2>&1`;
      }
      else {
          $out = `foo`;
      }

  }
  
  
  =head3 can_load_xs
  
      my $can_load_xs = $self->can_load_xs;
  
  Returns true if we have the ability to load XS.
  
  This is important because miniperl, used to build XS modules in the
  core, can not load XS.
  
  =cut
  
  sub can_load_xs {
      return defined &DynaLoader::boot_DynaLoader ? 1 : 0;
  }
  
  
  =head3 can_run
  
    use ExtUtils::MM;
    my $runnable = MM->can_run($Config{make});
  
  If called in a scalar context it will return the full path to the binary
  you asked for if it was found, or C<undef> if it was not.
  
  If called in a list context, it will return a list of the full paths to instances
  of the binary where found in C<PATH>, or an empty list if it was not found.
  
  Copied from L<IPC::Cmd|IPC::Cmd/"$path = can_run( PROGRAM );">, but modified into
  a method (and removed C<$INSTANCES> capability).

  Method that protects Makefile single-value constants (mainly filenames),

  =head3 split_command
  
      my @cmds = $MM->split_command($cmd, @args);
  
  Most OS have a maximum command length they can execute at once.  Large
  modules can easily generate commands well past that limit.  Its
  necessary to split long commands up into a series of shorter commands.
  
  C<split_command> will return a series of @cmds each processing part of
  the args.  Collectively they will process all the arguments.  Each
  individual line in @cmds will not be longer than the
  $self->max_exec_len being careful to take into account macro expansion.
  
  $cmd should include any switches and repeated initial arguments.
  
  If no @args are given, no @cmds will be returned.
  
  Pairs of arguments will always be preserved in a single command, this
  is a heuristic for things like pm_to_blib and pod2man which work on
  pairs of arguments.  This makes things like this safe:
  
      $self->split_command($cmd, %pod2man);
  
  
  =cut

      # newline.

      # set aside 30% for macro expansion.
      my $len_left = int($self->max_exec_len * 0.70);

  =head3 stashmeta

  Generates a set of C<@recipelines> which will result in the literal
  C<$text> ending up in literal C<$file> when the recipe is executed. Call
  it once, with all the text you want in C<$file>. Make macros will not
  be expanded, so the locations will be fixed at configure-time, not

      my @commands = $MM->echo($text);
      my @commands = $MM->echo($text, $file);
      my @commands = $MM->echo($text, $file, \%opts);
  
  Generates a set of @commands which print the $text to a $file.
  
  If $file is not given, output goes to STDOUT.
  
  If $opts{append} is true the $file will be appended to rather than
  overwritten.  Default is to overwrite.
  
  If $opts{allow_variables} is true, make variables of the form
  C<$(...)> will not be escaped.  Other C<$> will.  Default is to escape
  all C<$>.

  =head3 wraplist
  
    my $args = $mm->wraplist(@list);
  
  Takes an array of items and turns them into a well-formatted list of
  arguments.  In most cases this is simply something like:
  
      FOO \
      BAR \
      BAZ

  =head3 maketext_filter
  
      my $filter_make_text = $mm->maketext_filter($make_text);
  
  The text of the Makefile is run through this method before writing to
  disk.  It allows systems a chance to make portability fixes to the
  Makefile.
  
  By default it does nothing.
  
  This method is protected and not intended to be called outside of
  MakeMaker.
  
  =cut
  
  sub maketext_filter { return $_[1] }
  
  
  =head3 cd  I<Abstract>
  
    my $subdir_cmd = $MM->cd($subdir, @cmds);
  
  This will generate a make fragment which runs the @cmds in the given
  $dir.  The rough equivalent to this, except cross platform.
  
    cd $subdir && $cmd
  
  Currently $dir can only go down one level.  "foo" is fine.  "foo/bar" is
  not.  "../foo" is right out.
  
  The resulting $subdir_cmd has no leading tab nor trailing newline.  This
  makes it easier to embed in a make string.  For example.
  
        my $make = sprintf <<'CODE', $subdir_cmd;
    foo :
        $(ECHO) what
        %s
        $(ECHO) mouche
    CODE
  
  
  =head3 oneliner  I<Abstract>
  
    my $oneliner = $MM->oneliner($perl_code);
    my $oneliner = $MM->oneliner($perl_code, \@switches);
  
  This will generate a perl one-liner safe for the particular platform
  you're on based on the given $perl_code and @switches (a -e is
  assumed) suitable for using in a make target.  It will use the proper
  shell quoting and escapes.
  
  $(PERLRUN) will be used as perl.
  
  Any newlines in $perl_code will be escaped.  Leading and trailing
  newlines will be stripped.  Makes this idiom much easier:
  
      my $code = $MM->oneliner(<<'CODE', [...switches...]);
  some code here
  another line here
  CODE
  
  Usage might be something like:
  
      # an echo emulation
      $oneliner = $MM->oneliner('print "Foo\n"');
      $make = '$oneliner > somefile';
  
  Dollar signs in the $perl_code will be protected from make using the
  C<quote_literal> method, unless they are recognised as being a make
  variable, C<$(varname)>, in which case they will be left for make
  to expand. Remember to quote make macros else it might be used as a
  bareword. For example:
  
      # Assign the value of the $(VERSION_FROM) make macro to $vf.
      $oneliner = $MM->oneliner('$vf = "$(VERSION_FROM)"');
  
  Its currently very simple and may be expanded sometime in the figure
  to include more flexible code and switches.
  
  
  =head3 quote_literal  I<Abstract>
  
      my $safe_text = $MM->quote_literal($text);
      my $safe_text = $MM->quote_literal($text, \%options);
  
  This will quote $text so it is interpreted literally in the shell.
  
  For example, on Unix this would escape any single-quotes in $text and
  put single-quotes around the whole thing.
  
  If $options{allow_variables} is true it will leave C<'$(FOO)'> make
  variables untouched.  If false they will be escaped like any other
  C<$>.  Defaults to true.
  
  =head3 escape_dollarsigns
  
      my $escaped_text = $MM->escape_dollarsigns($text);
  
  Escapes stray C<$> so they are not interpreted as make variables.
  
  It lets by C<$(...)>.
  
  =cut
  
  sub escape_dollarsigns {
      my($self, $text) = @_;

      return $text;
  }
  
  
  =head3 escape_all_dollarsigns

  =head3 max_exec_len  I<Abstract>
  
      my $max_exec_len = $MM->max_exec_len;

  =head3 init_DIRFILESEP  I<Abstract>
  
    $MM->init_DIRFILESEP;
    my $dirfilesep = $MM->{DIRFILESEP};
  
  Initializes the DIRFILESEP macro which is the separator between the
  directory and filename in a filepath.  ie. / on Unix, \ on Win32 and
  nothing on VMS.
  
  For example:
  
      # instead of $(INST_ARCHAUTODIR)/extralibs.ld
      $(INST_ARCHAUTODIR)$(DIRFILESEP)extralibs.ld
  
  Something of a hack but it prevents a lot of code duplication between
  MM_* variants.
  
  Do not use this as a separator between directories.  Some operating
  systems use different separators between subdirectories as between
  directories and filenames (for example:  VOLUME:[dir1.dir2]file on VMS).
  
  =head3 init_linker  I<Abstract>
  
      $mm->init_linker;
  
  Initialize macros which have to do with linking.
  
  PERL_ARCHIVE: path to libperl.a equivalent to be linked to dynamic
  extensions.
  
  PERL_ARCHIVE_AFTER: path to a library which should be put on the
  linker command line I<after> the external libraries to be linked to
  dynamic extensions.  This may be needed if the linker is one-pass, and
  Perl includes some overrides for C RTL functions, such as malloc().
  
  EXPORT_LIST: name of a file that is passed to linker to define symbols
  to be exported.
  
  Some OSes do not need these in which case leave it blank.
  
  
  =head3 init_platform
  
      $mm->init_platform
  
  Initialize any macros which are for platform specific use only.
  
  A typical one is the version number of your OS specific module.
  (ie. MM_Unix_VERSION or MM_VMS_VERSION).
  
  =cut
  
  sub init_platform {

  Returns a definition for the POD2MAN macro.  This is a program
  which emulates the pod2man utility.  You can add more switches to the
  command by simply appending them on the macro.
  
  Typical usage:
  
      $(POD2MAN) --section=3 --perm_rw=$(PERM_RW) podfile1 man_page1 ...
  
  =cut
  
  sub POD2MAN_macro {

  Returns a $command line which just runs a single test without

  printed.
  
  Used for test.pl, since they don't always follow Test::Harness
  formatting.

          File::Spec->catfile($Config{archlibexp}, "Config.pm")
      );
  
  A sanity check that what Perl thinks the architecture is and what
  Config thinks the architecture is are the same.  If they're not it
  will return false and show a diagnostic message.
  
  When building Perl it will always return true, as nothing is installed
  yet.
  
  The interface is a bit odd because this is the result of a
  quick refactoring.  Don't rely on it.

  Your perl and your Config.pm seem to have different ideas about the
  architecture they are running on.
  Perl thinks: [$arch]
  Config says: [$Config{archname}]
  This may or may not cause problems. Please check your installation of perl
  if you have problems building this extension.

  VMS the $(PERL_INC) directory will already have delimiters in it, but in

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Once upon a time, MakeMaker could produce an approximation of a correct
  Makefile on MacOS Classic (MacPerl).  Due to a lack of maintainers, this
  fell out of sync with the rest of MakeMaker and hadn't worked in years.
  Since there's little chance of it being repaired, MacOS Classic is fading
  away, and the code was icky to begin with, the code has been deleted to
  make maintenance easier.
  
  Anyone interested in resurrecting this file should pull the old version
  from the MakeMaker CVS repository and contact makemaker@perl.org.

  =head1 NAME
  
  ExtUtils::MM_Unix - methods used by ExtUtils::MakeMaker
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  C<require ExtUtils::MM_Unix;>
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  The methods provided by this package are designed to be used in
  conjunction with ExtUtils::MakeMaker. When MakeMaker writes a
  Makefile, it creates one or more objects that inherit their methods
  from a package C<MM>. MM itself doesn't provide any methods, but it
  ISA ExtUtils::MM_Unix class. The inheritance tree of MM lets operating
  specific packages take the responsibility for all the methods provided
  by MM_Unix. We are trying to reduce the number of the necessary
  overrides by defining rather primitive operations within
  ExtUtils::MM_Unix.
  
  If you are going to write a platform specific MM package, please try
  to limit the necessary overrides to primitive methods, and if it is not
  possible to do so, let's work out how to achieve that gain.
  
  If you are overriding any of these methods in your Makefile.PL (in the
  MY class), please report that to the makemaker mailing list. We are
  trying to minimize the necessary method overrides and switch to data
  driven Makefile.PLs wherever possible. In the long run less methods
  will be overridable via the MY class.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  The following description of methods is still under
  development. Please refer to the code for not suitably documented
  sections and complain loudly to the makemaker@perl.org mailing list.
  Better yet, provide a patch.
  
  Not all of the methods below are overridable in a
  Makefile.PL. Overridable methods are marked as (o). All methods are
  overridable by a platform specific MM_*.pm file.
  
  Cross-platform methods are being moved into MM_Any.  If you can't find
  something that used to be in here, look in MM_Any.

  Does very much the same as the cflags script in the perl
  distribution. It doesn't return the whole compiler command line, but
  initializes all of its parts. The const_cccmd method then actually
  returns the definition of the CCCMD macro which uses these parts.

  this will attempt to remove '/usr' from the front of the

  =head1 NAME
  
  ExtUtils::MM_VMS - methods to override UN*X behaviour in ExtUtils::MakeMaker
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    Do not use this directly.
    Instead, use ExtUtils::MM and it will figure out which MM_*
    class to use for you.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  See ExtUtils::MM_Unix for a documentation of the methods provided
  there. This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not
  the semantics.

  Converts a list into a string wrapped at approximately 80 columns.

  # This isn't really an override.  It's just here because ExtUtils::MM_VMS
  # appears in @MM::ISA before ExtUtils::Liblist::Kid, so if there isn't an ext()
  # in MM_VMS, then AUTOLOAD is called, and bad things happen.  So, we just
  # mimic inheritance here and hand off to ExtUtils::Liblist::Kid.
  # XXX This hackery will die soon. --Schwern

  =head2 Methods
  
  Those methods which override default MM_Unix methods are marked
  "(override)", while methods unique to MM_VMS are marked "(specific)".
  For overridden methods, documentation is limited to an explanation
  of why this method overrides the MM_Unix method; see the ExtUtils::MM_Unix
  documentation for more details.

  =item guess_name (override)
  
  Try to determine name of extension being built.  We begin with the name
  of the current directory.  Since VMS filenames are case-insensitive,
  however, we look for a F<.pm> file whose name matches that of the current
  directory (presumably the 'main' F<.pm> file for this extension), and try
  to find a C<package> statement from which to obtain the Mixed::Case
  package name.

      # Fallback in case for some reason a user has copied the files for an
      # extension into a working directory whose name doesn't reflect the
      # extension's name.  We'll use the name of a unique .pm file, or the
      # first .pm file with a matching .xs file.

  =item _fixin_replace_shebang (override)
  
  Helper routine for MM->fixin(), overridden because there's no such thing as an
  actual shebang line that will be interpreted by the shell, so we just prepend
  $Config{startperl} and preserve the shebang line argument for any switches it
  may contain.

      return $Config{startperl} . "\n" . $Config{sharpbang} . "perl $arg\n";
  }
  
  =item maybe_command (override)
  
  Follows VMS naming conventions for executable files.
  If the name passed in doesn't exactly match an executable file,
  appends F<.Exe> (or equivalent) to check for executable image, and F<.Com>
  to check for DCL procedure.  If this fails, checks directories in DCL$PATH
  and finally F<Sys$System:> for an executable file having the name specified,
  with or without the F<.Exe>-equivalent suffix.
  
  =cut
  
  sub maybe_command {
      my($self,$file) = @_;

  =item pasthru (override)
  
  VMS has $(MMSQUALIFIERS) which is a listing of all the original command line
  options.  This is used in every invocation of make in the VMS Makefile so
  PASTHRU should not be necessary.  Using PASTHRU tends to blow commands past
  the 256 character limit.
  
  =cut

  =item pm_to_blib (override)
  
  VMS wants a dot in every file so we can't have one called 'pm_to_blib',
  it becomes 'pm_to_blib.' and MMS/K isn't smart enough to know that when
  you have a target called 'pm_to_blib' it should look for 'pm_to_blib.'.
  
  So in VMS its pm_to_blib.ts.
  
  =cut

      my $self = shift;

      $make = <<'MAKE' . $make;
  # Dummy target to match Unix target name; we use pm_to_blib.ts as
  # timestamp file to avoid repeated invocations under VMS
  pm_to_blib : pm_to_blib.ts
  	$(NOECHO) $(NOOP)
  
  MAKE
  
      return $make;
  }
  
  
  =item perl_script (override)
  
  If name passed in doesn't specify a readable file, appends F<.com> or
  F<.pl> and tries again, since it's customary to have file types on all files
  under VMS.
  
  =cut
  
  sub perl_script {
      my($self,$file) = @_;
      return $file if -r $file && ! -d _;

  Catchall routine to clean up problem MM[SK]/Make macros.  Expands macros
  in any directory specification, in order to avoid juxtaposing two

  are all macro, so that we can tell how long the expansion is, and avoid
  overrunning DCL's command buffer when MM[KS] is running.
  
  fixpath() checks to see whether the result matches the name of a
  directory in the current default directory and returns a directory or
  file specification accordingly.  C<$is_dir> can be set to true to
  force fixpath() to consider the path to be a directory or false to force
  it to be a file.

  ExtUtils::MM_Win95 - method to customize MakeMaker for Win9X
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    You should not be using this module directly.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This is a subclass of ExtUtils::MM_Win32 containing changes necessary
  to get MakeMaker playing nice with command.com and other Win9Xisms.
  
  =head2 Overridden methods
  
  Most of these make up for limitations in the Win9x/nmake command shell.

  ExtUtils::MY - ExtUtils::MakeMaker subclass for customization
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    # in your Makefile.PL
    sub MY::whatever {

    }
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  B<FOR INTERNAL USE ONLY>
  
  ExtUtils::MY is a subclass of ExtUtils::MM.  Its provided in your
  Makefile.PL for you to add and override MakeMaker functionality.
  
  It also provides a convenient alias via the MY class.
  
  ExtUtils::MY might turn out to be a temporary solution, but MY won't
  go away.

  =head1 NAME
  
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker - Create a module Makefile
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use ExtUtils::MakeMaker;
  
    WriteMakefile(
        NAME              => "Foo::Bar",
        VERSION_FROM      => "lib/Foo/Bar.pm",
    );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module
  from a Makefile.PL. It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by
  Andy Dougherty and the perl5-porters.
  
  It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines
  that can be individually overridden.  Each subroutine returns the text
  it wishes to have written to the Makefile.
  
  As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which
  use operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is
  important for users of this module to know which flavour of Make
  a Makefile has been written for so they'll use the correct one and
  won't have to face the possibly bewildering errors resulting from
  using the wrong one.
  
  On POSIX systems, that program will likely be GNU Make; on Microsoft
  Windows, it will be either Microsoft NMake, DMake or GNU Make.
  See the section on the L</"MAKE"> parameter for details.
  
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM) is object oriented. Each directory below the current
  directory that contains a Makefile.PL is treated as a separate
  object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of
  Makefiles with a single invocation of WriteMakefile().
  
  All inputs to WriteMakefile are Unicode characters, not just octets. EUMM
  seeks to handle all of these correctly. It is currently still not possible
  to portably use Unicode characters in module names, because this requires
  Perl to handle Unicode filenames, which is not yet the case on Windows.
  
  =head2 How To Write A Makefile.PL
  
  See L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker::Tutorial>.
  
  The long answer is the rest of the manpage :-)
  
  =head2 Default Makefile Behaviour
  
  The generated Makefile enables the user of the extension to invoke
  
    perl Makefile.PL # optionally "perl Makefile.PL verbose"
    make
    make test        # optionally set TEST_VERBOSE=1
    make install     # See below
  
  The Makefile to be produced may be altered by adding arguments of the
  form C<KEY=VALUE>. E.g.
  
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~
  
  Other interesting targets in the generated Makefile are
  
    make config     # to check if the Makefile is up-to-date
    make clean      # delete local temp files (Makefile gets renamed)
    make realclean  # delete derived files (including ./blib)
    make ci         # check in all the files in the MANIFEST file
    make dist       # see below the Distribution Support section
  
  =head2 make test
  
  MakeMaker checks for the existence of a file named F<test.pl> in the
  current directory, and if it exists it executes the script with the
  proper set of perl C<-I> options.
  
  MakeMaker also checks for any files matching glob("t/*.t"). It will
  execute all matching files in alphabetical order via the
  L<Test::Harness> module with the C<-I> switches set correctly.
  
  If you'd like to see the raw output of your tests, set the
  C<TEST_VERBOSE> variable to true.
  
    make test TEST_VERBOSE=1
  
  If you want to run particular test files, set the C<TEST_FILES> variable.
  It is possible to use globbing with this mechanism.
  
    make test TEST_FILES='t/foobar.t t/dagobah*.t'
  
  Windows users who are using C<nmake> should note that due to a bug in C<nmake>,
  when specifying C<TEST_FILES> you must use back-slashes instead of forward-slashes.
  
    nmake test TEST_FILES='t\foobar.t t\dagobah*.t'
  
  =head2 make testdb
  
  A useful variation of the above is the target C<testdb>. It runs the
  test under the Perl debugger (see L<perldebug>). If the file
  F<test.pl> exists in the current directory, it is used for the test.
  
  If you want to debug some other testfile, set the C<TEST_FILE> variable
  thusly:
  
    make testdb TEST_FILE=t/mytest.t
  
  By default the debugger is called using C<-d> option to perl. If you
  want to specify some other option, set the C<TESTDB_SW> variable:
  
    make testdb TESTDB_SW=-Dx
  
  =head2 make install
  
  make alone puts all relevant files into directories that are named by
  the macros INST_LIB, INST_ARCHLIB, INST_SCRIPT, INST_MAN1DIR and
  INST_MAN3DIR.  All these default to something below ./blib if you are
  I<not> building below the perl source directory. If you I<are>
  building below the perl source, INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB default to
  ../../lib, and INST_SCRIPT is not defined.
  
  The I<install> target of the generated Makefile copies the files found
  below each of the INST_* directories to their INSTALL*
  counterparts. Which counterparts are chosen depends on the setting of
  INSTALLDIRS according to the following table:
  
                                   INSTALLDIRS set to
                             perl        site          vendor
  
                   PERLPREFIX      SITEPREFIX          VENDORPREFIX
    INST_ARCHLIB   INSTALLARCHLIB  INSTALLSITEARCH     INSTALLVENDORARCH
    INST_LIB       INSTALLPRIVLIB  INSTALLSITELIB      INSTALLVENDORLIB
    INST_BIN       INSTALLBIN      INSTALLSITEBIN      INSTALLVENDORBIN
    INST_SCRIPT    INSTALLSCRIPT   INSTALLSITESCRIPT   INSTALLVENDORSCRIPT
    INST_MAN1DIR   INSTALLMAN1DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
    INST_MAN3DIR   INSTALLMAN3DIR  INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR  INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR
  
  The INSTALL... macros in turn default to their %Config
  ($Config{installprivlib}, $Config{installarchlib}, etc.) counterparts.
  
  You can check the values of these variables on your system with
  
      perl '-V:install.*'
  
  And to check the sequence in which the library directories are
  searched by perl, run
  
      perl -le 'print join $/, @INC'
  
  Sometimes older versions of the module you're installing live in other
  directories in @INC.  Because Perl loads the first version of a module it
  finds, not the newest, you might accidentally get one of these older
  versions even after installing a brand new version.  To delete I<all other
  versions of the module you're installing> (not simply older ones) set the
  C<UNINST> variable.
  
      make install UNINST=1
  
  
  =head2 INSTALL_BASE
  
  INSTALL_BASE can be passed into Makefile.PL to change where your
  module will be installed.  INSTALL_BASE is more like what everyone
  else calls "prefix" than PREFIX is.
  
  To have everything installed in your home directory, do the following.
  
      # Unix users, INSTALL_BASE=~ works fine
      perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/path/to/your/home/dir
  
  Like PREFIX, it sets several INSTALL* attributes at once.  Unlike
  PREFIX it is easy to predict where the module will end up.  The
  installation pattern looks like this:
  
      INSTALLARCHLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5/$Config{archname}
      INSTALLPRIVLIB     INSTALL_BASE/lib/perl5
      INSTALLBIN         INSTALL_BASE/bin
      INSTALLSCRIPT      INSTALL_BASE/bin
      INSTALLMAN1DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man1
      INSTALLMAN3DIR     INSTALL_BASE/man/man3
  
  INSTALL_BASE in MakeMaker and C<--install_base> in Module::Build (as
  of 0.28) install to the same location.  If you want MakeMaker and
  Module::Build to install to the same location simply set INSTALL_BASE
  and C<--install_base> to the same location.
  
  INSTALL_BASE was added in 6.31.
  
  
  =head2 PREFIX and LIB attribute
  
  PREFIX and LIB can be used to set several INSTALL* attributes in one
  go.  Here's an example for installing into your home directory.
  
      # Unix users, PREFIX=~ works fine
      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/path/to/your/home/dir
  
  This will install all files in the module under your home directory,
  with man pages and libraries going into an appropriate place (usually
  ~/man and ~/lib).  How the exact location is determined is complicated
  and depends on how your Perl was configured.  INSTALL_BASE works more
  like what other build systems call "prefix" than PREFIX and we
  recommend you use that instead.
  
  Another way to specify many INSTALL directories with a single
  parameter is LIB.
  
      perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/lib
  
  This will install the module's architecture-independent files into
  ~/lib, the architecture-dependent files into ~/lib/$archname.
  
  Note, that in both cases the tilde expansion is done by MakeMaker, not
  by perl by default, nor by make.
  
  Conflicts between parameters LIB, PREFIX and the various INSTALL*
  arguments are resolved so that:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  setting LIB overrides any setting of INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
  INSTALLSITELIB, INSTALLSITEARCH (and they are not affected by PREFIX);
  
  =item *
  
  without LIB, setting PREFIX replaces the initial C<$Config{prefix}>
  part of those INSTALL* arguments, even if the latter are explicitly
  set (but are set to still start with C<$Config{prefix}>).
  
  =back
  
  If the user has superuser privileges, and is not working on AFS or
  relatives, then the defaults for INSTALLPRIVLIB, INSTALLARCHLIB,
  INSTALLSCRIPT, etc. will be appropriate, and this incantation will be
  the best:
  
      perl Makefile.PL;
      make;
      make test
      make install
  
  make install by default writes some documentation of what has been
  done into the file C<$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod>. This feature
  can be bypassed by calling make pure_install.
  
  =head2 AFS users
  
  will have to specify the installation directories as these most
  probably have changed since perl itself has been installed. They will
  have to do this by calling
  
      perl Makefile.PL INSTALLSITELIB=/afs/here/today \
          INSTALLSCRIPT=/afs/there/now INSTALLMAN3DIR=/afs/for/manpages
      make
  
  Be careful to repeat this procedure every time you recompile an
  extension, unless you are sure the AFS installation directories are
  still valid.
  
  =head2 Static Linking of a new Perl Binary
  
  An extension that is built with the above steps is ready to use on
  systems supporting dynamic loading. On systems that do not support
  dynamic loading, any newly created extension has to be linked together
  with the available resources. MakeMaker supports the linking process
  by creating appropriate targets in the Makefile whenever an extension
  is built. You can invoke the corresponding section of the makefile with
  
      make perl
  
  That produces a new perl binary in the current directory with all
  extensions linked in that can be found in INST_ARCHLIB, SITELIBEXP,
  and PERL_ARCHLIB. To do that, MakeMaker writes a new Makefile, on
  UNIX, this is called F<Makefile.aperl> (may be system dependent). If you
  want to force the creation of a new perl, it is recommended that you
  delete this F<Makefile.aperl>, so the directories are searched through
  for linkable libraries again.
  
  The binary can be installed into the directory where perl normally
  resides on your machine with
  
      make inst_perl
  
  To produce a perl binary with a different name than C<perl>, either say
  
      perl Makefile.PL MAP_TARGET=myperl
      make myperl
      make inst_perl
  
  or say
  
      perl Makefile.PL
      make myperl MAP_TARGET=myperl
      make inst_perl MAP_TARGET=myperl
  
  In any case you will be prompted with the correct invocation of the
  C<inst_perl> target that installs the new binary into INSTALLBIN.
  
  make inst_perl by default writes some documentation of what has been
  done into the file C<$(INSTALLARCHLIB)/perllocal.pod>. This
  can be bypassed by calling make pure_inst_perl.
  
  Warning: the inst_perl: target will most probably overwrite your
  existing perl binary. Use with care!
  
  Sometimes you might want to build a statically linked perl although
  your system supports dynamic loading. In this case you may explicitly
  set the linktype with the invocation of the Makefile.PL or make:
  
      perl Makefile.PL LINKTYPE=static    # recommended
  
  or
  
      make LINKTYPE=static                # works on most systems
  
  =head2 Determination of Perl Library and Installation Locations
  
  MakeMaker needs to know, or to guess, where certain things are
  located.  Especially INST_LIB and INST_ARCHLIB (where to put the files
  during the make(1) run), PERL_LIB and PERL_ARCHLIB (where to read
  existing modules from), and PERL_INC (header files and C<libperl*.*>).
  
  Extensions may be built either using the contents of the perl source
  directory tree or from the installed perl library. The recommended way
  is to build extensions after you have run 'make install' on perl
  itself. You can do that in any directory on your hard disk that is not
  below the perl source tree. The support for extensions below the ext
  directory of the perl distribution is only good for the standard
  extensions that come with perl.
  
  If an extension is being built below the C<ext/> directory of the perl
  source then MakeMaker will set PERL_SRC automatically (e.g.,
  C<../..>).  If PERL_SRC is defined and the extension is recognized as
  a standard extension, then other variables default to the following:
  
    PERL_INC     = PERL_SRC
    PERL_LIB     = PERL_SRC/lib
    PERL_ARCHLIB = PERL_SRC/lib
    INST_LIB     = PERL_LIB
    INST_ARCHLIB = PERL_ARCHLIB
  
  If an extension is being built away from the perl source then MakeMaker
  will leave PERL_SRC undefined and default to using the installed copy
  of the perl library. The other variables default to the following:
  
    PERL_INC     = $archlibexp/CORE
    PERL_LIB     = $privlibexp
    PERL_ARCHLIB = $archlibexp
    INST_LIB     = ./blib/lib
    INST_ARCHLIB = ./blib/arch
  
  If perl has not yet been installed then PERL_SRC can be defined on the
  command line as shown in the previous section.
  
  
  =head2 Which architecture dependent directory?
  
  If you don't want to keep the defaults for the INSTALL* macros,
  MakeMaker helps you to minimize the typing needed: the usual
  relationship between INSTALLPRIVLIB and INSTALLARCHLIB is determined
  by Configure at perl compilation time. MakeMaker supports the user who
  sets INSTALLPRIVLIB. If INSTALLPRIVLIB is set, but INSTALLARCHLIB not,
  then MakeMaker defaults the latter to be the same subdirectory of
  INSTALLPRIVLIB as Configure decided for the counterparts in %Config,
  otherwise it defaults to INSTALLPRIVLIB. The same relationship holds
  for INSTALLSITELIB and INSTALLSITEARCH.
  
  MakeMaker gives you much more freedom than needed to configure
  internal variables and get different results. It is worth mentioning
  that make(1) also lets you configure most of the variables that are
  used in the Makefile. But in the majority of situations this will not
  be necessary, and should only be done if the author of a package
  recommends it (or you know what you're doing).
  
  =head2 Using Attributes and Parameters
  
  The following attributes may be specified as arguments to WriteMakefile()
  or as NAME=VALUE pairs on the command line. Attributes that became
  available with later versions of MakeMaker are indicated.
  
  In order to maintain portability of attributes with older versions of
  MakeMaker you may want to use L<App::EUMM::Upgrade> with your C<Makefile.PL>.
  
  =over 2
  
  =item ABSTRACT
  
  One line description of the module. Will be included in PPD file.
  
  =item ABSTRACT_FROM
  
  Name of the file that contains the package description. MakeMaker looks
  for a line in the POD matching /^($package\s-\s)(.*)/. This is typically
  the first line in the "=head1 NAME" section. $2 becomes the abstract.
  
  =item AUTHOR
  
  Array of strings containing name (and email address) of package author(s).
  Is used in CPAN Meta files (META.yml or META.json) and PPD
  (Perl Package Description) files for PPM (Perl Package Manager).
  
  =item BINARY_LOCATION
  
  Used when creating PPD files for binary packages.  It can be set to a
  full or relative path or URL to the binary archive for a particular
  architecture.  For example:
  
          perl Makefile.PL BINARY_LOCATION=x86/Agent.tar.gz
  
  builds a PPD package that references a binary of the C<Agent> package,
  located in the C<x86> directory relative to the PPD itself.
  
  =item BUILD_REQUIRES
  
  Available in version 6.5503 and above.
  
  A hash of modules that are needed to build your module but not run it.
  
  This will go into the C<build_requires> field of your F<META.yml> and the C<build> of the C<prereqs> field of your F<META.json>.
  
  Defaults to C<<< { "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" => 0 } >>> if this attribute is not specified.
  
  The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.
  
  =item C
  
  Ref to array of *.c file names. Initialised from a directory scan
  and the values portion of the XS attribute hash. This is not
  currently used by MakeMaker but may be handy in Makefile.PLs.
  
  =item CCFLAGS
  
  String that will be included in the compiler call command line between
  the arguments INC and OPTIMIZE.
  
  =item CONFIG
  
  Arrayref. E.g. [qw(archname manext)] defines ARCHNAME & MANEXT from
  config.sh. MakeMaker will add to CONFIG the following values anyway:
  ar
  cc
  cccdlflags
  ccdlflags
  dlext
  dlsrc
  ld
  lddlflags
  ldflags
  libc
  lib_ext
  obj_ext
  ranlib
  sitelibexp
  sitearchexp
  so
  
  =item CONFIGURE
  
  CODE reference. The subroutine should return a hash reference. The
  hash may contain further attributes, e.g. {LIBS =E<gt> ...}, that have to
  be determined by some evaluation method.
  
  =item CONFIGURE_REQUIRES
  
  Available in version 6.52 and above.
  
  A hash of modules that are required to run Makefile.PL itself, but not
  to run your distribution.
  
  This will go into the C<configure_requires> field of your F<META.yml> and the C<configure> of the C<prereqs> field of your F<META.json>.
  
  Defaults to C<<< { "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" => 0 } >>> if this attribute is not specified.
  
  The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.
  
  =item DEFINE
  
  Something like C<"-DHAVE_UNISTD_H">
  
  =item DESTDIR
  
  This is the root directory into which the code will be installed.  It
  I<prepends itself to the normal prefix>.  For example, if your code
  would normally go into F</usr/local/lib/perl> you could set DESTDIR=~/tmp/
  and installation would go into F<~/tmp/usr/local/lib/perl>.
  
  This is primarily of use for people who repackage Perl modules.
  
  NOTE: Due to the nature of make, it is important that you put the trailing
  slash on your DESTDIR.  F<~/tmp/> not F<~/tmp>.
  
  =item DIR
  
  Ref to array of subdirectories containing Makefile.PLs e.g. ['sdbm']
  in ext/SDBM_File
  
  =item DISTNAME
  
  A safe filename for the package.
  
  Defaults to NAME below but with :: replaced with -.
  
  For example, Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar.
  
  =item DISTVNAME
  
  Your name for distributing the package with the version number
  included.  This is used by 'make dist' to name the resulting archive
  file.
  
  Defaults to DISTNAME-VERSION.
  
  For example, version 1.04 of Foo::Bar becomes Foo-Bar-1.04.
  
  On some OS's where . has special meaning VERSION_SYM may be used in
  place of VERSION.
  
  =item DLEXT
  
  Specifies the extension of the module's loadable object. For example:
  
    DLEXT => 'unusual_ext', # Default value is $Config{so}
  
  NOTE: When using this option to alter the extension of a module's
  loadable object, it is also necessary that the module's pm file
  specifies the same change:
  
    local $DynaLoader::dl_dlext = 'unusual_ext';
  
  =item DL_FUNCS
  
  Hashref of symbol names for routines to be made available as universal
  symbols.  Each key/value pair consists of the package name and an
  array of routine names in that package.  Used only under AIX, OS/2,
  VMS and Win32 at present.  The routine names supplied will be expanded
  in the same way as XSUB names are expanded by the XS() macro.
  Defaults to
  
    {"$(NAME)" => ["boot_$(NAME)" ] }
  
  e.g.
  
    {"RPC" => [qw( boot_rpcb rpcb_gettime getnetconfigent )],
     "NetconfigPtr" => [ 'DESTROY'] }
  
  Please see the L<ExtUtils::Mksymlists> documentation for more information
  about the DL_FUNCS, DL_VARS and FUNCLIST attributes.
  
  =item DL_VARS
  
  Array of symbol names for variables to be made available as universal symbols.
  Used only under AIX, OS/2, VMS and Win32 at present.  Defaults to [].
  (e.g. [ qw(Foo_version Foo_numstreams Foo_tree ) ])
  
  =item EXCLUDE_EXT
  
  Array of extension names to exclude when doing a static build.  This
  is ignored if INCLUDE_EXT is present.  Consult INCLUDE_EXT for more
  details.  (e.g.  [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ] )
  
  This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string on the
  command line:  perl Makefile.PL EXCLUDE_EXT='Socket Safe'
  
  =item EXE_FILES
  
  Ref to array of executable files. The files will be copied to the
  INST_SCRIPT directory. Make realclean will delete them from there
  again.
  
  If your executables start with something like #!perl or
  #!/usr/bin/perl MakeMaker will change this to the path of the perl
  'Makefile.PL' was invoked with so the programs will be sure to run
  properly even if perl is not in /usr/bin/perl.
  
  =item FIRST_MAKEFILE
  
  The name of the Makefile to be produced.  This is used for the second
  Makefile that will be produced for the MAP_TARGET.
  
  Defaults to 'Makefile' or 'Descrip.MMS' on VMS.
  
  (Note: we couldn't use MAKEFILE because dmake uses this for something
  else).
  
  =item FULLPERL
  
  Perl binary able to run this extension, load XS modules, etc...
  
  =item FULLPERLRUN
  
  Like PERLRUN, except it uses FULLPERL.
  
  =item FULLPERLRUNINST
  
  Like PERLRUNINST, except it uses FULLPERL.
  
  =item FUNCLIST
  
  This provides an alternate means to specify function names to be
  exported from the extension.  Its value is a reference to an
  array of function names to be exported by the extension.  These
  names are passed through unaltered to the linker options file.
  
  =item H
  
  Ref to array of *.h file names. Similar to C.
  
  =item IMPORTS
  
  This attribute is used to specify names to be imported into the
  extension. Takes a hash ref.
  
  It is only used on OS/2 and Win32.
  
  =item INC
  
  Include file dirs eg: C<"-I/usr/5include -I/path/to/inc">
  
  =item INCLUDE_EXT
  
  Array of extension names to be included when doing a static build.
  MakeMaker will normally build with all of the installed extensions when
  doing a static build, and that is usually the desired behavior.  If
  INCLUDE_EXT is present then MakeMaker will build only with those extensions
  which are explicitly mentioned. (e.g.  [ qw( Socket POSIX ) ])
  
  It is not necessary to mention DynaLoader or the current extension when
  filling in INCLUDE_EXT.  If the INCLUDE_EXT is mentioned but is empty then
  only DynaLoader and the current extension will be included in the build.
  
  This attribute may be most useful when specified as a string on the
  command line:  perl Makefile.PL INCLUDE_EXT='POSIX Socket Devel::Peek'
  
  =item INSTALLARCHLIB
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to perl.
  
  =item INSTALLBIN
  
  Directory to install binary files (e.g. tkperl) into if
  INSTALLDIRS=perl.
  
  =item INSTALLDIRS
  
  Determines which of the sets of installation directories to choose:
  perl, site or vendor.  Defaults to site.
  
  =item INSTALLMAN1DIR
  
  =item INSTALLMAN3DIR
  
  These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if
  INSTALLDIRS=perl.  Defaults to $Config{installman*dir}.
  
  If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.
  
  =item INSTALLPRIVLIB
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to perl.
  
  Defaults to $Config{installprivlib}.
  
  =item INSTALLSCRIPT
  
  Used by 'make install' which copies files from INST_SCRIPT to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS=perl.
  
  =item INSTALLSITEARCH
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).
  
  =item INSTALLSITEBIN
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_BIN to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).
  
  =item INSTALLSITELIB
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).
  
  =item INSTALLSITEMAN1DIR
  
  =item INSTALLSITEMAN3DIR
  
  These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if
  INSTALLDIRS=site (default).  Defaults to
  $(SITEPREFIX)/man/man$(MAN*EXT).
  
  If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.
  
  =item INSTALLSITESCRIPT
  
  Used by 'make install' which copies files from INST_SCRIPT to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to site (default).
  
  =item INSTALLVENDORARCH
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_ARCHLIB to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor.
  
  =item INSTALLVENDORBIN
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_BIN to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor.
  
  =item INSTALLVENDORLIB
  
  Used by 'make install', which copies files from INST_LIB to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor.
  
  =item INSTALLVENDORMAN1DIR
  
  =item INSTALLVENDORMAN3DIR
  
  These directories get the man pages at 'make install' time if
  INSTALLDIRS=vendor.  Defaults to $(VENDORPREFIX)/man/man$(MAN*EXT).
  
  If set to 'none', no man pages will be installed.
  
  =item INSTALLVENDORSCRIPT
  
  Used by 'make install' which copies files from INST_SCRIPT to this
  directory if INSTALLDIRS is set to vendor.
  
  =item INST_ARCHLIB
  
  Same as INST_LIB for architecture dependent files.
  
  =item INST_BIN
  
  Directory to put real binary files during 'make'. These will be copied
  to INSTALLBIN during 'make install'
  
  =item INST_LIB
  
  Directory where we put library files of this extension while building
  it.
  
  =item INST_MAN1DIR
  
  Directory to hold the man pages at 'make' time
  
  =item INST_MAN3DIR
  
  Directory to hold the man pages at 'make' time
  
  =item INST_SCRIPT
  
  Directory where executable files should be installed during
  'make'. Defaults to "./blib/script", just to have a dummy location during
  testing. make install will copy the files in INST_SCRIPT to
  INSTALLSCRIPT.
  
  =item LD
  
  Program to be used to link libraries for dynamic loading.
  
  Defaults to $Config{ld}.
  
  =item LDDLFLAGS
  
  Any special flags that might need to be passed to ld to create a
  shared library suitable for dynamic loading.  It is up to the makefile
  to use it.  (See L<Config/lddlflags>)
  
  Defaults to $Config{lddlflags}.
  
  =item LDFROM
  
  Defaults to "$(OBJECT)" and is used in the ld command to specify
  what files to link/load from (also see dynamic_lib below for how to
  specify ld flags)
  
  =item LIB
  
  LIB should only be set at C<perl Makefile.PL> time but is allowed as a
  MakeMaker argument. It has the effect of setting both INSTALLPRIVLIB
  and INSTALLSITELIB to that value regardless any explicit setting of
  those arguments (or of PREFIX).  INSTALLARCHLIB and INSTALLSITEARCH
  are set to the corresponding architecture subdirectory.
  
  =item LIBPERL_A
  
  The filename of the perllibrary that will be used together with this
  extension. Defaults to libperl.a.
  
  =item LIBS
  
  An anonymous array of alternative library
  specifications to be searched for (in order) until
  at least one library is found. E.g.
  
    'LIBS' => ["-lgdbm", "-ldbm -lfoo", "-L/path -ldbm.nfs"]
  
  Mind, that any element of the array
  contains a complete set of arguments for the ld
  command. So do not specify
  
    'LIBS' => ["-ltcl", "-ltk", "-lX11"]
  
  See ODBM_File/Makefile.PL for an example, where an array is needed. If
  you specify a scalar as in
  
    'LIBS' => "-ltcl -ltk -lX11"
  
  MakeMaker will turn it into an array with one element.
  
  =item LICENSE
  
  Available in version 6.31 and above.
  
  The licensing terms of your distribution.  Generally it's "perl_5" for the
  same license as Perl itself.
  
  See L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> for the list of options.
  
  Defaults to "unknown".
  
  =item LINKTYPE
  
  'static' or 'dynamic' (default unless usedl=undef in
  config.sh). Should only be used to force static linking (also see
  linkext below).
  
  =item MAGICXS
  
  When this is set to C<1>, C<OBJECT> will be automagically derived from
  C<O_FILES>.
  
  =item MAKE
  
  Variant of make you intend to run the generated Makefile with.  This
  parameter lets Makefile.PL know what make quirks to account for when
  generating the Makefile.
  
  MakeMaker also honors the MAKE environment variable.  This parameter
  takes precedence.
  
  Currently the only significant values are 'dmake' and 'nmake' for Windows
  users, instructing MakeMaker to generate a Makefile in the flavour of
  DMake ("Dennis Vadura's Make") or Microsoft NMake respectively.
  
  Defaults to $Config{make}, which may go looking for a Make program
  in your environment.
  
  How are you supposed to know what flavour of Make a Makefile has
  been generated for if you didn't specify a value explicitly? Search
  the generated Makefile for the definition of the MAKE variable,
  which is used to recursively invoke the Make utility. That will tell
  you what Make you're supposed to invoke the Makefile with.
  
  =item MAKEAPERL
  
  Boolean which tells MakeMaker that it should include the rules to
  make a perl. This is handled automatically as a switch by
  MakeMaker. The user normally does not need it.
  
  =item MAKEFILE_OLD
  
  When 'make clean' or similar is run, the $(FIRST_MAKEFILE) will be
  backed up at this location.
  
  Defaults to $(FIRST_MAKEFILE).old or $(FIRST_MAKEFILE)_old on VMS.
  
  =item MAN1PODS
  
  Hashref of pod-containing files. MakeMaker will default this to all
  EXE_FILES files that include POD directives. The files listed
  here will be converted to man pages and installed as was requested
  at Configure time.
  
  This hash should map POD files (or scripts containing POD) to the
  man file names under the C<blib/man1/> directory, as in the following
  example:
  
    MAN1PODS            => {
      'doc/command.pod'    => 'blib/man1/command.1',
      'scripts/script.pl'  => 'blib/man1/script.1',
    }
  
  =item MAN3PODS
  
  Hashref that assigns to *.pm and *.pod files the files into which the
  manpages are to be written. MakeMaker parses all *.pod and *.pm files
  for POD directives. Files that contain POD will be the default keys of
  the MAN3PODS hashref. These will then be converted to man pages during
  C<make> and will be installed during C<make install>.
  
  Example similar to MAN1PODS.
  
  =item MAP_TARGET
  
  If it is intended that a new perl binary be produced, this variable
  may hold a name for that binary. Defaults to perl
  
  =item META_ADD
  
  =item META_MERGE
  
  Available in version 6.46 and above.
  
  A hashref of items to add to the CPAN Meta file (F<META.yml> or
  F<META.json>).
  
  They differ in how they behave if they have the same key as the
  default metadata.  META_ADD will override the default value with its
  own.  META_MERGE will merge its value with the default.
  
  Unless you want to override the defaults, prefer META_MERGE so as to
  get the advantage of any future defaults.
  
  Where prereqs are concerned, if META_MERGE is used, prerequisites are merged
  with their counterpart C<WriteMakefile()> argument
  (PREREQ_PM is merged into {prereqs}{runtime}{requires},
  BUILD_REQUIRES into C<{prereqs}{build}{requires}>,
  CONFIGURE_REQUIRES into C<{prereqs}{configure}{requires}>,
  and TEST_REQUIRES into C<{prereqs}{test}{requires})>.
  When prereqs are specified with META_ADD, the only prerequisites added to the
  file come from the metadata, not C<WriteMakefile()> arguments.
  
  Note that these configuration options are only used for generating F<META.yml>
  and F<META.json> -- they are NOT used for F<MYMETA.yml> and F<MYMETA.json>.
  Therefore data in these fields should NOT be used for dynamic (user-side)
  configuration.
  
  By default CPAN Meta specification C<1.4> is used. In order to use
  CPAN Meta specification C<2.0>, indicate with C<meta-spec> the version
  you want to use.
  
    META_MERGE        => {
  
      "meta-spec" => { version => 2 },
  
      resources => {
  
        repository => {
            type => 'git',
            url => 'git://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/ExtUtils-MakeMaker.git',
            web => 'https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/ExtUtils-MakeMaker',
        },
  
      },
  
    },
  
  =item MIN_PERL_VERSION
  
  Available in version 6.48 and above.
  
  The minimum required version of Perl for this distribution.
  
  Either the 5.006001 or the 5.6.1 format is acceptable.
  
  =item MYEXTLIB
  
  If the extension links to a library that it builds, set this to the
  name of the library (see SDBM_File)
  
  =item NAME
  
  The package representing the distribution. For example, C<Test::More>
  or C<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>. It will be used to derive information about
  the distribution such as the L</DISTNAME>, installation locations
  within the Perl library and where XS files will be looked for by
  default (see L</XS>).
  
  C<NAME> I<must> be a valid Perl package name and it I<must> have an
  associated C<.pm> file. For example, C<Foo::Bar> is a valid C<NAME>
  and there must exist F<Foo/Bar.pm>.  Any XS code should be in
  F<Bar.xs> unless stated otherwise.
  
  Your distribution B<must> have a C<NAME>.
  
  =item NEEDS_LINKING
  
  MakeMaker will figure out if an extension contains linkable code
  anywhere down the directory tree, and will set this variable
  accordingly, but you can speed it up a very little bit if you define
  this boolean variable yourself.
  
  =item NOECHO
  
  Command so make does not print the literal commands it's running.
  
  By setting it to an empty string you can generate a Makefile that
  prints all commands. Mainly used in debugging MakeMaker itself.
  
  Defaults to C<@>.
  
  =item NORECURS
  
  Boolean.  Attribute to inhibit descending into subdirectories.
  
  =item NO_META
  
  When true, suppresses the generation and addition to the MANIFEST of
  the META.yml and META.json module meta-data files during 'make distdir'.
  
  Defaults to false.
  
  =item NO_MYMETA
  
  When true, suppresses the generation of MYMETA.yml and MYMETA.json module
  meta-data files during 'perl Makefile.PL'.
  
  Defaults to false.
  
  =item NO_PACKLIST
  
  When true, suppresses the writing of C<packlist> files for installs.
  
  Defaults to false.
  
  =item NO_PERLLOCAL
  
  When true, suppresses the appending of installations to C<perllocal>.
  
  Defaults to false.
  
  =item NO_VC
  
  In general, any generated Makefile checks for the current version of
  MakeMaker and the version the Makefile was built under. If NO_VC is
  set, the version check is neglected. Do not write this into your
  Makefile.PL, use it interactively instead.
  
  =item OBJECT
  
  List of object files, defaults to '$(BASEEXT)$(OBJ_EXT)', but can be a long
  string or an array containing all object files, e.g. "tkpBind.o
  tkpButton.o tkpCanvas.o" or ["tkpBind.o", "tkpButton.o", "tkpCanvas.o"]
  
  (Where BASEEXT is the last component of NAME, and OBJ_EXT is $Config{obj_ext}.)
  
  =item OPTIMIZE
  
  Defaults to C<-O>. Set it to C<-g> to turn debugging on. The flag is
  passed to subdirectory makes.
  
  =item PERL
  
  Perl binary for tasks that can be done by miniperl. If it contains
  spaces or other shell metacharacters, it needs to be quoted in a way
  that protects them, since this value is intended to be inserted in a
  shell command line in the Makefile. E.g.:
  
    # Perl executable lives in "C:/Program Files/Perl/bin"
    # Normally you don't need to set this yourself!
    $ perl Makefile.PL PERL='"C:/Program Files/Perl/bin/perl.exe" -w'
  
  =item PERL_CORE
  
  Set only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core
  distribution.
  
  =item PERLMAINCC
  
  The call to the program that is able to compile perlmain.c. Defaults
  to $(CC).
  
  =item PERL_ARCHLIB
  
  Same as for PERL_LIB, but for architecture dependent files.
  
  Used only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core
  distribution (because normally $(PERL_ARCHLIB) is automatically in @INC,
  and adding it would get in the way of PERL5LIB).
  
  =item PERL_LIB
  
  Directory containing the Perl library to use.
  
  Used only when MakeMaker is building the extensions of the Perl core
  distribution (because normally $(PERL_LIB) is automatically in @INC,
  and adding it would get in the way of PERL5LIB).
  
  =item PERL_MALLOC_OK
  
  defaults to 0.  Should be set to TRUE if the extension can work with
  the memory allocation routines substituted by the Perl malloc() subsystem.
  This should be applicable to most extensions with exceptions of those
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  with bugs in memory allocations which are caught by Perl's malloc();
  
  =item *
  
  which interact with the memory allocator in other ways than via
  malloc(), realloc(), free(), calloc(), sbrk() and brk();
  
  =item *
  
  which rely on special alignment which is not provided by Perl's malloc().
  
  =back
  
  B<NOTE.>  Neglecting to set this flag in I<any one> of the loaded extension
  nullifies many advantages of Perl's malloc(), such as better usage of
  system resources, error detection, memory usage reporting, catchable failure
  of memory allocations, etc.
  
  =item PERLPREFIX
  
  Directory under which core modules are to be installed.
  
  Defaults to $Config{installprefixexp}, falling back to
  $Config{installprefix}, $Config{prefixexp} or $Config{prefix} should
  $Config{installprefixexp} not exist.
  
  Overridden by PREFIX.
  
  =item PERLRUN
  
  Use this instead of $(PERL) when you wish to run perl.  It will set up
  extra necessary flags for you.
  
  =item PERLRUNINST
  
  Use this instead of $(PERL) when you wish to run perl to work with
  modules.  It will add things like -I$(INST_ARCH) and other necessary
  flags so perl can see the modules you're about to install.
  
  =item PERL_SRC
  
  Directory containing the Perl source code (use of this should be
  avoided, it may be undefined)
  
  =item PERM_DIR
  
  Desired permission for directories. Defaults to C<755>.
  
  =item PERM_RW
  
  Desired permission for read/writable files. Defaults to C<644>.
  
  =item PERM_RWX
  
  Desired permission for executable files. Defaults to C<755>.
  
  =item PL_FILES
  
  MakeMaker can run programs to generate files for you at build time.
  By default any file named *.PL (except Makefile.PL and Build.PL) in
  the top level directory will be assumed to be a Perl program and run
  passing its own basename in as an argument.  This basename is actually a build
  target, and there is an intention, but not a requirement, that the *.PL file
  make the file passed to to as an argument. For example...
  
      perl foo.PL foo
  
  This behavior can be overridden by supplying your own set of files to
  search.  PL_FILES accepts a hash ref, the key being the file to run
  and the value is passed in as the first argument when the PL file is run.
  
      PL_FILES => {'bin/foobar.PL' => 'bin/foobar'}
  
      PL_FILES => {'foo.PL' => 'foo.c'}
  
  Would run bin/foobar.PL like this:
  
      perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar
  
  If multiple files from one program are desired an array ref can be used.
  
      PL_FILES => {'bin/foobar.PL' => [qw(bin/foobar1 bin/foobar2)]}
  
  In this case the program will be run multiple times using each target file.
  
      perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar1
      perl bin/foobar.PL bin/foobar2
  
  PL files are normally run B<after> pm_to_blib and include INST_LIB and
  INST_ARCH in their C<@INC>, so the just built modules can be
  accessed... unless the PL file is making a module (or anything else in
  PM) in which case it is run B<before> pm_to_blib and does not include
  INST_LIB and INST_ARCH in its C<@INC>.  This apparently odd behavior
  is there for backwards compatibility (and it's somewhat DWIM).  The argument
  passed to the .PL is set up as a target to build in the Makefile.  In other
  sections such as C<postamble> you can specify a dependency on the
  filename/argument that the .PL is supposed (or will have, now that that is
  is a dependency) to generate.  Note the file to be generated will still be
  generated and the .PL will still run even without an explicit dependency created
  by you, since the C<all> target still depends on running all eligible to run.PL
  files.
  
  =item PM
  
  Hashref of .pm files and *.pl files to be installed.  e.g.
  
    {'name_of_file.pm' => '$(INST_LIB)/install_as.pm'}
  
  By default this will include *.pm and *.pl and the files found in
  the PMLIBDIRS directories.  Defining PM in the
  Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.
  
  =item PMLIBDIRS
  
  Ref to array of subdirectories containing library files.  Defaults to
  [ 'lib', $(BASEEXT) ]. The directories will be scanned and I<any> files
  they contain will be installed in the corresponding location in the
  library.  A libscan() method can be used to alter the behaviour.
  Defining PM in the Makefile.PL will override PMLIBDIRS.
  
  (Where BASEEXT is the last component of NAME.)
  
  =item PM_FILTER
  
  A filter program, in the traditional Unix sense (input from stdin, output
  to stdout) that is passed on each .pm file during the build (in the
  pm_to_blib() phase).  It is empty by default, meaning no filtering is done.
  You could use:
  
    PM_FILTER => 'perl -ne "print unless /^\\#/"',
  
  to remove all the leading comments on the fly during the build.  In order
  to be as portable as possible, please consider using a Perl one-liner
  rather than Unix (or other) utilities, as above.  The # is escaped for
  the Makefile, since what is going to be generated will then be:
  
    PM_FILTER = perl -ne "print unless /^\#/"
  
  Without the \ before the #, we'd have the start of a Makefile comment,
  and the macro would be incorrectly defined.
  
  You will almost certainly be better off using the C<PL_FILES> system,
  instead. See above, or the L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker::FAQ> entry.
  
  =item POLLUTE
  
  Release 5.005 grandfathered old global symbol names by providing preprocessor
  macros for extension source compatibility.  As of release 5.6, these
  preprocessor definitions are not available by default.  The POLLUTE flag
  specifies that the old names should still be defined:
  
    perl Makefile.PL POLLUTE=1
  
  Please inform the module author if this is necessary to successfully install
  a module under 5.6 or later.
  
  =item PPM_INSTALL_EXEC
  
  Name of the executable used to run C<PPM_INSTALL_SCRIPT> below. (e.g. perl)
  
  =item PPM_INSTALL_SCRIPT
  
  Name of the script that gets executed by the Perl Package Manager after
  the installation of a package.
  
  =item PPM_UNINSTALL_EXEC
  
  Name of the executable used to run C<PPM_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT> below. (e.g. perl)
  
  =item PPM_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT
  
  Name of the script that gets executed by the Perl Package Manager before
  the removal of a package.
  
  =item PREFIX
  
  This overrides all the default install locations.  Man pages,
  libraries, scripts, etc...  MakeMaker will try to make an educated
  guess about where to place things under the new PREFIX based on your
  Config defaults.  Failing that, it will fall back to a structure
  which should be sensible for your platform.
  
  If you specify LIB or any INSTALL* variables they will not be affected
  by the PREFIX.
  
  =item PREREQ_FATAL
  
  Bool. If this parameter is true, failing to have the required modules
  (or the right versions thereof) will be fatal. C<perl Makefile.PL>
  will C<die> instead of simply informing the user of the missing dependencies.
  
  It is I<extremely> rare to have to use C<PREREQ_FATAL>. Its use by module
  authors is I<strongly discouraged> and should never be used lightly.
  
  For dependencies that are required in order to run C<Makefile.PL>,
  see C<CONFIGURE_REQUIRES>.
  
  Module installation tools have ways of resolving unmet dependencies but
  to do that they need a F<Makefile>.  Using C<PREREQ_FATAL> breaks this.
  That's bad.
  
  Assuming you have good test coverage, your tests should fail with
  missing dependencies informing the user more strongly that something
  is wrong.  You can write a F<t/00compile.t> test which will simply
  check that your code compiles and stop "make test" prematurely if it
  doesn't.  See L<Test::More/BAIL_OUT> for more details.
  
  
  =item PREREQ_PM
  
  A hash of modules that are needed to run your module.  The keys are
  the module names ie. Test::More, and the minimum version is the
  value. If the required version number is 0 any version will do.
  The versions given may be a Perl v-string (see L<version>) or a range
  (see L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements>).
  
  This will go into the C<requires> field of your F<META.yml> and the
  C<runtime> of the C<prereqs> field of your F<META.json>.
  
      PREREQ_PM => {
          # Require Test::More at least 0.47
          "Test::More" => "0.47",
  
          # Require any version of Acme::Buffy
          "Acme::Buffy" => 0,
      }
  
  =item PREREQ_PRINT
  
  Bool.  If this parameter is true, the prerequisites will be printed to
  stdout and MakeMaker will exit.  The output format is an evalable hash
  ref.
  
    $PREREQ_PM = {
                   'A::B' => Vers1,
                   'C::D' => Vers2,
                   ...
                 };
  
  If a distribution defines a minimal required perl version, this is
  added to the output as an additional line of the form:
  
    $MIN_PERL_VERSION = '5.008001';
  
  If BUILD_REQUIRES is not empty, it will be dumped as $BUILD_REQUIRES hashref.
  
  =item PRINT_PREREQ
  
  RedHatism for C<PREREQ_PRINT>.  The output format is different, though:
  
      perl(A::B)>=Vers1 perl(C::D)>=Vers2 ...
  
  A minimal required perl version, if present, will look like this:
  
      perl(perl)>=5.008001
  
  =item SITEPREFIX
  
  Like PERLPREFIX, but only for the site install locations.
  
  Defaults to $Config{siteprefixexp}.  Perls prior to 5.6.0 didn't have
  an explicit siteprefix in the Config.  In those cases
  $Config{installprefix} will be used.
  
  Overridable by PREFIX
  
  =item SIGN
  
  When true, perform the generation and addition to the MANIFEST of the
  SIGNATURE file in the distdir during 'make distdir', via 'cpansign
  -s'.
  
  Note that you need to install the Module::Signature module to
  perform this operation.
  
  Defaults to false.
  
  =item SKIP
  
  Arrayref. E.g. [qw(name1 name2)] skip (do not write) sections of the
  Makefile. Caution! Do not use the SKIP attribute for the negligible
  speedup. It may seriously damage the resulting Makefile. Only use it
  if you really need it.
  
  =item TEST_REQUIRES
  
  Available in version 6.64 and above.
  
  A hash of modules that are needed to test your module but not run or
  build it.
  
  This will go into the C<build_requires> field of your F<META.yml> and the C<test> of the C<prereqs> field of your F<META.json>.
  
  The format is the same as PREREQ_PM.
  
  =item TYPEMAPS
  
  Ref to array of typemap file names.  Use this when the typemaps are
  in some directory other than the current directory or when they are
  not named B<typemap>.  The last typemap in the list takes
  precedence.  A typemap in the current directory has highest
  precedence, even if it isn't listed in TYPEMAPS.  The default system
  typemap has lowest precedence.
  
  =item VENDORPREFIX
  
  Like PERLPREFIX, but only for the vendor install locations.
  
  Defaults to $Config{vendorprefixexp}.
  
  Overridable by PREFIX
  
  =item VERBINST
  
  If true, make install will be verbose
  
  =item VERSION
  
  Your version number for distributing the package.  This defaults to
  0.1.
  
  =item VERSION_FROM
  
  Instead of specifying the VERSION in the Makefile.PL you can let
  MakeMaker parse a file to determine the version number. The parsing
  routine requires that the file named by VERSION_FROM contains one
  single line to compute the version number. The first line in the file
  that contains something like a $VERSION assignment or C<package Name
  VERSION> will be used. The following lines will be parsed o.k.:
  
      # Good
      package Foo::Bar 1.23;                      # 1.23
      $VERSION   = '1.00';                        # 1.00
      *VERSION   = \'1.01';                       # 1.01
      ($VERSION) = q$Revision$ =~ /(\d+)/g;       # The digits in $Revision$
      $FOO::VERSION = '1.10';                     # 1.10
      *FOO::VERSION = \'1.11';                    # 1.11
  
  but these will fail:
  
      # Bad
      my $VERSION         = '1.01';
      local $VERSION      = '1.02';
      local $FOO::VERSION = '1.30';
  
  (Putting C<my> or C<local> on the preceding line will work o.k.)
  
  "Version strings" are incompatible and should not be used.
  
      # Bad
      $VERSION = 1.2.3;
      $VERSION = v1.2.3;
  
  L<version> objects are fine.  As of MakeMaker 6.35 version.pm will be
  automatically loaded, but you must declare the dependency on version.pm.
  For compatibility with older MakeMaker you should load on the same line
  as $VERSION is declared.
  
      # All on one line
      use version; our $VERSION = qv(1.2.3);
  
  The file named in VERSION_FROM is not added as a dependency to
  Makefile. This is not really correct, but it would be a major pain
  during development to have to rewrite the Makefile for any smallish
  change in that file. If you want to make sure that the Makefile
  contains the correct VERSION macro after any change of the file, you
  would have to do something like
  
      depend => { Makefile => '$(VERSION_FROM)' }
  
  See attribute C<depend> below.
  
  =item VERSION_SYM
  
  A sanitized VERSION with . replaced by _.  For places where . has
  special meaning (some filesystems, RCS labels, etc...)
  
  =item XS
  
  Hashref of .xs files. MakeMaker will default this.  e.g.
  
    {'name_of_file.xs' => 'name_of_file.c'}
  
  The .c files will automatically be included in the list of files
  deleted by a make clean.
  
  =item XSBUILD
  
  Hashref with options controlling the operation of C<XSMULTI>:
  
    {
      xs => {
          all => {
              # options applying to all .xs files for this distribution
          },
          'lib/Class/Name/File' => { # specifically for this file
              DEFINE => '-Dfunktastic', # defines for only this file
              INC => "-I$funkyliblocation", # include flags for only this file
              # OBJECT => 'lib/Class/Name/File$(OBJ_EXT)', # default
              LDFROM => "lib/Class/Name/File\$(OBJ_EXT) $otherfile\$(OBJ_EXT)", # what's linked
          },
      },
    }
  
  Note C<xs> is the file-extension. More possibilities may arise in the
  future. Note that object names are specified without their XS extension.
  
  C<LDFROM> defaults to the same as C<OBJECT>. C<OBJECT> defaults to,
  for C<XSMULTI>, just the XS filename with the extension replaced with
  the compiler-specific object-file extension.
  
  The distinction between C<OBJECT> and C<LDFROM>: C<OBJECT> is the make
  target, so make will try to build it. However, C<LDFROM> is what will
  actually be linked together to make the shared object or static library
  (SO/SL), so if you override it, make sure it includes what you want to
  make the final SO/SL, almost certainly including the XS basename with
  C<$(OBJ_EXT)> appended.
  
  =item XSMULTI
  
  When this is set to C<1>, multiple XS files may be placed under F<lib/>
  next to their corresponding C<*.pm> files (this is essential for compiling
  with the correct C<VERSION> values). This feature should be considered
  experimental, and details of it may change.
  
  This feature was inspired by, and small portions of code copied from,
  L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker::BigHelper>. Hopefully this feature will render
  that module mainly obsolete.
  
  =item XSOPT
  
  String of options to pass to xsubpp.  This might include C<-C++> or
  C<-extern>.  Do not include typemaps here; the TYPEMAP parameter exists for
  that purpose.
  
  =item XSPROTOARG
  
  May be set to C<-protoypes>, C<-noprototypes> or the empty string.  The
  empty string is equivalent to the xsubpp default, or C<-noprototypes>.
  See the xsubpp documentation for details.  MakeMaker
  defaults to the empty string.
  
  =item XS_VERSION
  
  Your version number for the .xs file of this package.  This defaults
  to the value of the VERSION attribute.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Additional lowercase attributes
  
  can be used to pass parameters to the methods which implement that
  part of the Makefile.  Parameters are specified as a hash ref but are
  passed to the method as a hash.

  =item clean
  
    {FILES => "*.xyz foo"}
  
  =item depend
  
    {ANY_TARGET => ANY_DEPENDENCY, ...}
  
  (ANY_TARGET must not be given a double-colon rule by MakeMaker.)
  
  =item dist
  
    {TARFLAGS => 'cvfF', COMPRESS => 'gzip', SUFFIX => '.gz',
    SHAR => 'shar -m', DIST_CP => 'ln', ZIP => '/bin/zip',
    ZIPFLAGS => '-rl', DIST_DEFAULT => 'private tardist' }
  
  If you specify COMPRESS, then SUFFIX should also be altered, as it is
  needed to tell make the target file of the compression. Setting
  DIST_CP to ln can be useful, if you need to preserve the timestamps on
  your files. DIST_CP can take the values 'cp', which copies the file,
  'ln', which links the file, and 'best' which copies symbolic links and
  links the rest. Default is 'best'.

  =head2 Overriding MakeMaker Methods
  
  If you cannot achieve the desired Makefile behaviour by specifying
  attributes you may define private subroutines in the Makefile.PL.
  Each subroutine returns the text it wishes to have written to
  the Makefile. To override a section of the Makefile you can
  either say:
  
          sub MY::c_o { "new literal text" }
  
  or you can edit the default by saying something like:
  
          package MY; # so that "SUPER" works right
          sub c_o {
              my $inherited = shift->SUPER::c_o(@_);
              $inherited =~ s/old text/new text/;
              $inherited;
          }
  
  If you are running experiments with embedding perl as a library into
  other applications, you might find MakeMaker is not sufficient. You'd
  better have a look at ExtUtils::Embed which is a collection of utilities
  for embedding.
  
  If you still need a different solution, try to develop another
  subroutine that fits your needs and submit the diffs to
  C<makemaker@perl.org>
  
  For a complete description of all MakeMaker methods see
  L<ExtUtils::MM_Unix>.
  
  Here is a simple example of how to add a new target to the generated
  Makefile:
  
      sub MY::postamble {
          return <<'MAKE_FRAG';
      $(MYEXTLIB): sdbm/Makefile
              cd sdbm && $(MAKE) all
  
      MAKE_FRAG
      }
  
  =head2 The End Of Cargo Cult Programming
  
  WriteMakefile() now does some basic sanity checks on its parameters to
  protect against typos and malformatted values.  This means some things
  which happened to work in the past will now throw warnings and
  possibly produce internal errors.
  
  Some of the most common mistakes:
  
  =over 2
  
  =item C<< MAN3PODS => ' ' >>
  
  This is commonly used to suppress the creation of man pages.  MAN3PODS
  takes a hash ref not a string, but the above worked by accident in old
  versions of MakeMaker.
  
  The correct code is C<< MAN3PODS => { } >>.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 Hintsfile support
  
  MakeMaker.pm uses the architecture-specific information from
  Config.pm. In addition it evaluates architecture specific hints files
  in a C<hints/> directory. The hints files are expected to be named
  like their counterparts in C<PERL_SRC/hints>, but with an C<.pl> file
  name extension (eg. C<next_3_2.pl>). They are simply C<eval>ed by
  MakeMaker within the WriteMakefile() subroutine, and can be used to
  execute commands as well as to include special variables. The rules
  which hintsfile is chosen are the same as in Configure.
  
  The hintsfile is eval()ed immediately after the arguments given to
  WriteMakefile are stuffed into a hash reference $self but before this
  reference becomes blessed. So if you want to do the equivalent to
  override or create an attribute you would say something like
  
      $self->{LIBS} = ['-ldbm -lucb -lc'];
  
  =head2 Distribution Support
  
  For authors of extensions MakeMaker provides several Makefile
  targets. Most of the support comes from the ExtUtils::Manifest module,
  where additional documentation can be found.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item    make distcheck
  
  reports which files are below the build directory but not in the
  MANIFEST file and vice versa. (See ExtUtils::Manifest::fullcheck() for
  details)
  
  =item    make skipcheck
  
  reports which files are skipped due to the entries in the
  C<MANIFEST.SKIP> file (See ExtUtils::Manifest::skipcheck() for
  details)
  
  =item    make distclean
  
  does a realclean first and then the distcheck. Note that this is not
  needed to build a new distribution as long as you are sure that the
  MANIFEST file is ok.
  
  =item    make veryclean
  
  does a realclean first and then removes backup files such as C<*~>,
  C<*.bak>, C<*.old> and C<*.orig>
  
  =item    make manifest
  
  rewrites the MANIFEST file, adding all remaining files found (See
  ExtUtils::Manifest::mkmanifest() for details)
  
  =item    make distdir
  
  Copies all the files that are in the MANIFEST file to a newly created
  directory with the name C<$(DISTNAME)-$(VERSION)>. If that directory
  exists, it will be removed first.
  
  Additionally, it will create META.yml and META.json module meta-data file
  in the distdir and add this to the distdir's MANIFEST.  You can shut this
  behavior off with the NO_META flag.
  
  =item   make disttest
  
  Makes a distdir first, and runs a C<perl Makefile.PL>, a make, and
  a make test in that directory.
  
  =item    make tardist
  
  First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null
  command, followed by $(TO_UNIX), which defaults to a null command under
  UNIX, and will convert files in distribution directory to UNIX format
  otherwise. Next it runs C<tar> on that directory into a tarfile and
  deletes the directory. Finishes with a command $(POSTOP) which
  defaults to a null command.
  
  =item    make dist
  
  Defaults to $(DIST_DEFAULT) which in turn defaults to tardist.
  
  =item    make uutardist
  
  Runs a tardist first and uuencodes the tarfile.
  
  =item    make shdist
  
  First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null
  command. Next it runs C<shar> on that directory into a sharfile and
  deletes the intermediate directory again. Finishes with a command
  $(POSTOP) which defaults to a null command.  Note: For shdist to work
  properly a C<shar> program that can handle directories is mandatory.
  
  =item    make zipdist
  
  First does a distdir. Then a command $(PREOP) which defaults to a null
  command. Runs C<$(ZIP) $(ZIPFLAGS)> on that directory into a
  zipfile. Then deletes that directory. Finishes with a command
  $(POSTOP) which defaults to a null command.
  
  =item    make ci
  
  Does a $(CI) and a $(RCS_LABEL) on all files in the MANIFEST file.
  
  =back
  
  Customization of the dist targets can be done by specifying a hash
  reference to the dist attribute of the WriteMakefile call. The
  following parameters are recognized:
  
      CI           ('ci -u')
      COMPRESS     ('gzip --best')
      POSTOP       ('@ :')
      PREOP        ('@ :')
      TO_UNIX      (depends on the system)
      RCS_LABEL    ('rcs -q -Nv$(VERSION_SYM):')
      SHAR         ('shar')
      SUFFIX       ('.gz')
      TAR          ('tar')
      TARFLAGS     ('cvf')
      ZIP          ('zip')
      ZIPFLAGS     ('-r')
  
  An example:
  
      WriteMakefile(
          ...other options...
          dist => {
              COMPRESS => "bzip2",
              SUFFIX   => ".bz2"
          }
      );
  
  
  =head2 Module Meta-Data (META and MYMETA)
  
  Long plaguing users of MakeMaker based modules has been the problem of
  getting basic information about the module out of the sources
  I<without> running the F<Makefile.PL> and doing a bunch of messy
  heuristics on the resulting F<Makefile>.  Over the years, it has become
  standard to keep this information in one or more CPAN Meta files
  distributed with each distribution.
  
  The original format of CPAN Meta files was L<YAML> and the corresponding
  file was called F<META.yml>.  In 2010, version 2 of the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>
  was released, which mandates JSON format for the metadata in order to
  overcome certain compatibility issues between YAML serializers and to
  avoid breaking older clients unable to handle a new version of the spec.
  The L<CPAN::Meta> library is now standard for accessing old and new-style
  Meta files.
  
  If L<CPAN::Meta> is installed, MakeMaker will automatically generate
  F<META.json> and F<META.yml> files for you and add them to your F<MANIFEST> as
  part of the 'distdir' target (and thus the 'dist' target).  This is intended to
  seamlessly and rapidly populate CPAN with module meta-data.  If you wish to
  shut this feature off, set the C<NO_META> C<WriteMakefile()> flag to true.
  
  At the 2008 QA Hackathon in Oslo, Perl module toolchain maintainers agrees
  to use the CPAN Meta format to communicate post-configuration requirements
  between toolchain components.  These files, F<MYMETA.json> and F<MYMETA.yml>,
  are generated when F<Makefile.PL> generates a F<Makefile> (if L<CPAN::Meta>
  is installed).  Clients like L<CPAN> or L<CPANPLUS> will read this
  files to see what prerequisites must be fulfilled before building or testing
  the distribution.  If you with to shut this feature off, set the C<NO_MYMETA>
  C<WriteMakeFile()> flag to true.
  
  =head2 Disabling an extension
  
  If some events detected in F<Makefile.PL> imply that there is no way
  to create the Module, but this is a normal state of things, then you
  can create a F<Makefile> which does nothing, but succeeds on all the
  "usual" build targets.  To do so, use
  
      use ExtUtils::MakeMaker qw(WriteEmptyMakefile);
      WriteEmptyMakefile();
  
  instead of WriteMakefile().
  
  This may be useful if other modules expect this module to be I<built>
  OK, as opposed to I<work> OK (say, this system-dependent module builds
  in a subdirectory of some other distribution, or is listed as a
  dependency in a CPAN::Bundle, but the functionality is supported by
  different means on the current architecture).
  
  =head2 Other Handy Functions
  
  =over 4
  
  =item prompt
  
      my $value = prompt($message);
      my $value = prompt($message, $default);
  
  The C<prompt()> function provides an easy way to request user input
  used to write a makefile.  It displays the $message as a prompt for
  input.  If a $default is provided it will be used as a default.  The
  function returns the $value selected by the user.
  
  If C<prompt()> detects that it is not running interactively and there
  is nothing on STDIN or if the PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT environment variable
  is set to true, the $default will be used without prompting.  This
  prevents automated processes from blocking on user input.
  
  If no $default is provided an empty string will be used instead.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Supported versions of Perl
  
  Please note that while this module works on Perl 5.6, it is no longer
  being routinely tested on 5.6 - the earliest Perl version being routinely
  tested, and expressly supported, is 5.8.1. However, patches to repair
  any breakage on 5.6 are still being accepted.
  
  =head1 ENVIRONMENT
  
  =over 4
  
  =item PERL_MM_OPT
  
  Command line options used by C<MakeMaker-E<gt>new()>, and thus by
  C<WriteMakefile()>.  The string is split as the shell would, and the result
  is processed before any actual command line arguments are processed.
  
    PERL_MM_OPT='CCFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath -Wl,/foo/bar/lib" LIBS="-lwibble -lwobble"'
  
  =item PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT
  
  If set to a true value then MakeMaker's prompt function will
  always return the default without waiting for user input.
  
  =item PERL_CORE
  
  Same as the PERL_CORE parameter.  The parameter overrides this.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 SEE ALSO
  
  L<Module::Build> is a pure-Perl alternative to MakeMaker which does
  not rely on make or any other external utility.  It is easier to
  extend to suit your needs.
  
  L<Module::Install> is a wrapper around MakeMaker which adds features
  not normally available.
  
  L<ExtUtils::ModuleMaker> and L<Module::Starter> are both modules to
  help you setup your distribution.
  
  L<CPAN::Meta> and L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> explain CPAN Meta files in detail.
  
  L<File::ShareDir::Install> makes it easy to install static, sometimes
  also referred to as 'shared' files. L<File::ShareDir> helps accessing
  the shared files after installation.
  
  L<Dist::Zilla> makes it easy for the module author to create MakeMaker-based
  distributions with lots of bells and whistles.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
  processes.  Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
  based.  Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
  from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
  
  The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
  requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and
  output.  The C<Encode::Locale> module looks up the charset and encoding (called
  a CODESET in the locale jargon) and arranges for the L<Encode> module to know
  this encoding under the name "locale".  It means bytes obtained from the
  environment can be converted to Unicode strings by calling C<<
  Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) >> and converted back again with C<<
  Encode::decode(locale => $string) >>.
  
  Where file systems interfaces pass file names in and out of the program we also
  need care.  The trend is for operating systems to use a fixed file encoding
  that don't actually depend on the locale; and this module determines the most
  appropriate encoding for file names. The L<Encode> module will know this
  encoding under the name "locale_fs".  For traditional Unix systems this will
  be an alias to the same encoding as "locale".
  
  For programs running in a terminal window (called a "Console" on some systems)
  the "locale" encoding is usually a good choice for what to expect as input and
  output.  Some systems allows us to query the encoding set for the terminal and
  C<Encode::Locale> will do that if available and make these encodings known
  under the C<Encode> aliases "console_in" and "console_out".  For systems where
  we can't determine the terminal encoding these will be aliased as the same
  encoding as "locale".  The advice is to use "console_in" for input known to
  come from the terminal and "console_out" for output to the terminal.
  
  In addition to arranging for various Encode aliases the following functions and
  variables are provided:
  
  =over
  
  =item decode_argv( )
  
  =item decode_argv( Encode::FB_CROAK )
  
  This will decode the command line arguments to perl (the C<@ARGV> array) in-place.
  
  The function will by default replace characters that can't be decoded by
  "\x{FFFD}", the Unicode replacement character.
  
  Any argument provided is passed as CHECK to underlying Encode::decode() call.
  Pass the value C<Encode::FB_CROAK> to have the decoding croak if not all the
  command line arguments can be decoded.  See L<Encode/"Handling Malformed Data">
  for details on other options for CHECK.
  
  =item env( $uni_key )
  
  =item env( $uni_key => $uni_value )
  
  Interface to get/set environment variables.  Returns the current value as a
  Unicode string. The $uni_key and $uni_value arguments are expected to be
  Unicode strings as well.  Passing C<undef> as $uni_value deletes the
  environment variable named $uni_key.
  
  The returned value will have the characters that can't be decoded replaced by
  "\x{FFFD}", the Unicode replacement character.
  
  There is no interface to request alternative CHECK behavior as for
  decode_argv().  If you need that you need to call encode/decode yourself.
  For example:
  
      my $key = Encode::encode(locale => $uni_key, Encode::FB_CROAK);
      my $uni_value = Encode::decode(locale => $ENV{$key}, Encode::FB_CROAK);
  
  =item reinit( )
  
  =item reinit( $encoding )
  
  Reinitialize the encodings from the locale.  You want to call this function if
  you changed anything in the environment that might influence the locale.
  
  This function will croak if the determined encoding isn't recognized by
  the Encode module.
  
  With argument force $ENCODING_... variables to set to the given value.
  
  =item $ENCODING_LOCALE
  
  The encoding name determined to be suitable for the current locale.
  L<Encode> know this encoding as "locale".
  
  =item $ENCODING_LOCALE_FS
  
  The encoding name determined to be suitable for file system interfaces
  involving file names.
  L<Encode> know this encoding as "locale_fs".
  
  =item $ENCODING_CONSOLE_IN
  
  =item $ENCODING_CONSOLE_OUT
  
  The encodings to be used for reading and writing output to the a console.
  L<Encode> know these encodings as "console_in" and "console_out".

  =head1 NOTES
  
  This table summarizes the mapping of the encodings set up
  by the C<Encode::Locale> module:
  
    Encode      |         |              |
    Alias       | Windows | Mac OS X     | POSIX
    ------------+---------+--------------+------------
    locale      | ANSI    | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo
    locale_fs   | ANSI    | UTF-8        | nl_langinfo
    console_in  | OEM     | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo
    console_out | OEM     | nl_langinfo  | nl_langinfo
  
  =head2 Windows
  
  Windows has basically 2 sets of APIs.  A wide API (based on passing UTF-16
  strings) and a byte based API based a character set called ANSI.  The
  regular Perl interfaces to the OS currently only uses the ANSI APIs.
  Unfortunately ANSI is not a single character set.
  
  The encoding that corresponds to ANSI varies between different editions of
  Windows.  For many western editions of Windows ANSI corresponds to CP-1252
  which is a character set similar to ISO-8859-1.  Conceptually the ANSI
  character set is a similar concept to the POSIX locale CODESET so this module
  figures out what the ANSI code page is and make this available as
  $ENCODING_LOCALE and the "locale" Encoding alias.
  
  Windows systems also operate with another byte based character set.
  It's called the OEM code page.  This is the encoding that the Console
  takes as input and output.  It's common for the OEM code page to
  differ from the ANSI code page.
  
  =head2 Mac OS X
  
  On Mac OS X the file system encoding is always UTF-8 while the locale
  can otherwise be set up as normal for POSIX systems.
  
  File names on Mac OS X will at the OS-level be converted to
  NFD-form.  A file created by passing a NFC-filename will come
  in NFD-form from readdir().  See L<Unicode::Normalize> for details
  of NFD/NFC.
  
  Actually, Apple does not follow the Unicode NFD standard since not all
  character ranges are decomposed.  The claim is that this avoids problems with
  round trip conversions from old Mac text encodings.  See L<Encode::UTF8Mac> for
  details.
  
  =head2 POSIX (Linux and other Unixes)
  
  File systems might vary in what encoding is to be used for
  filenames.  Since this module has no way to actually figure out
  what the is correct it goes with the best guess which is to
  assume filenames are encoding according to the current locale.
  Users are advised to always specify UTF-8 as the locale charset.

  =head2 Functions
  
  ExtUtils::Manifest exports no functions by default.  The following are
  exported on request
  
  =over 4
  
  =item mkmanifest
  
      mkmanifest();
  
  Writes all files in and below the current directory to your F<MANIFEST>.
  It works similar to the result of the Unix command
  
      find . > MANIFEST
  
  All files that match any regular expression in a file F<MANIFEST.SKIP>
  (if it exists) are ignored.
  
  Any existing F<MANIFEST> file will be saved as F<MANIFEST.bak>.

  checks if all the files within a C<MANIFEST> in the current directory
  really do exist. If C<MANIFEST> and the tree below the current
  directory are in sync it silently returns an empty list.
  Otherwise it returns a list of files which are listed in the
  C<MANIFEST> but missing from the directory, and by default also
  outputs these names to STDERR.

  finds files below the current directory that are not mentioned in the
  C<MANIFEST> file. An optional file C<MANIFEST.SKIP> will be
  consulted. Any file matching a regular expression in such a file will
  not be reported as missing in the C<MANIFEST> file. The list of any
  extraneous files found is returned, and by default also reported to
  STDERR.

  Copies the files that are the keys in %src to the $dest_dir.  %src is
  typically returned by the maniread() function.
  
      manicopy( maniread(), $dest_dir );
  
  This function is useful for producing a directory tree identical to the
  intended distribution tree.
  
  $how can be used to specify a different methods of "copying".  Valid
  values are C<cp>, which actually copies the files, C<ln> which creates
  hard links, and C<best> which mostly links the files but copies any
  symbolic link to make a tree without any symbolic link.  C<cp> is the
  default.

  =head2 MANIFEST
  
  A list of files in the distribution, one file per line.  The MANIFEST
  always uses Unix filepath conventions even if you're not on Unix.  This
  means F<foo/bar> style not F<foo\bar>.
  
  Anything between white space and an end of line within a C<MANIFEST>
  file is considered to be a comment.  Any line beginning with # is also
  a comment. Beginning with ExtUtils::Manifest 1.52, a filename may
  contain whitespace characters if it is enclosed in single quotes; single
  quotes or backslashes in that filename must be backslash-escaped.
  
      # this a comment
      some/file
      some/other/file            comment about some/file
      'some/third file'          comment
  
  
  =head2 MANIFEST.SKIP
  
  The file MANIFEST.SKIP may contain regular expressions of files that
  should be ignored by mkmanifest() and filecheck(). The regular
  expressions should appear one on each line. Blank lines and lines
  which start with C<#> are skipped.  Use C<\#> if you need a regular
  expression to start with a C<#>.
  
  For example:
  
      # Version control files and dirs.
      \bRCS\b
      \bCVS\b
      ,v$
      \B\.svn\b
  
      # Makemaker generated files and dirs.
      ^MANIFEST\.
      ^Makefile$
      ^blib/
      ^MakeMaker-\d
  
      # Temp, old and emacs backup files.
      ~$
      \.old$
      ^#.*#$
      ^\.#
  
  If no MANIFEST.SKIP file is found, a default set of skips will be
  used, similar to the example above.  If you want nothing skipped,
  simply make an empty MANIFEST.SKIP file.
  
  In one's own MANIFEST.SKIP file, certain directives
  can be used to include the contents of other MANIFEST.SKIP
  files. At present two such directives are recognized.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item #!include_default
  
  This inserts the contents of the default MANIFEST.SKIP file
  
  =item #!include /Path/to/another/manifest.skip
  
  This inserts the contents of the specified external file
  
  =back
  
  The included contents will be inserted into the MANIFEST.SKIP
  file in between I<#!start included /path/to/manifest.skip>
  and I<#!end included /path/to/manifest.skip> markers.
  The original MANIFEST.SKIP is saved as MANIFEST.SKIP.bak.
  
  =head2 EXPORT_OK
  
  C<&mkmanifest>, C<&manicheck>, C<&filecheck>, C<&fullcheck>,
  C<&maniread>, and C<&manicopy> are exportable.
  
  =head2 GLOBAL VARIABLES
  
  C<$ExtUtils::Manifest::MANIFEST> defaults to C<MANIFEST>. Changing it
  results in both a different C<MANIFEST> and a different
  C<MANIFEST.SKIP> file. This is useful if you want to maintain
  different distributions for different audiences (say a user version
  and a developer version including RCS).
  
  C<$ExtUtils::Manifest::Quiet> defaults to 0. If set to a true value,
  all functions act silently.
  
  C<$ExtUtils::Manifest::Debug> defaults to 0.  If set to a true value,
  or if PERL_MM_MANIFEST_DEBUG is true, debugging output will be
  produced.
  
  =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
  
  All diagnostic output is sent to C<STDERR>.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item C<Not in MANIFEST:> I<file>
  
  is reported if a file is found which is not in C<MANIFEST>.
  
  =item C<Skipping> I<file>
  
  is reported if a file is skipped due to an entry in C<MANIFEST.SKIP>.
  
  =item C<No such file:> I<file>
  
  is reported if a file mentioned in a C<MANIFEST> file does not
  exist.
  
  =item C<MANIFEST:> I<$!>
  
  is reported if C<MANIFEST> could not be opened.
  
  =item C<Added to MANIFEST:> I<file>
  
  is reported by mkmanifest() if $Verbose is set and a file is added
  to MANIFEST. $Verbose is set to 1 by default.

  =head1 NAME
  
  ExtUtils::Mkbootstrap - make a bootstrap file for use by DynaLoader
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  C<Mkbootstrap>
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Mkbootstrap typically gets called from an extension Makefile.
  
  There is no C<*.bs> file supplied with the extension. Instead, there may
  be a C<*_BS> file which has code for the special cases, like posix for
  berkeley db on the NeXT.
  
  This file will get parsed, and produce a maybe empty
  C<@DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using> array for the current architecture.
  That will be extended by $BSLOADLIBS, which was computed by
  ExtUtils::Liblist::ext(). If this array still is empty, we do nothing,
  else we write a .bs file with an C<@DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using>
  array.
  
  The C<*_BS> file can put some code into the generated C<*.bs> file by
  placing it in C<$bscode>. This is a handy 'escape' mechanism that may
  prove useful in complex situations.
  
  If @DynaLoader::dl_resolve_using contains C<-L*> or C<-l*> entries then
  Mkbootstrap will automatically add a dl_findfile() call to the
  generated C<*.bs> file.

  =head1 NAME
  
  ExtUtils::Mksymlists - write linker options files for dynamic extension
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use ExtUtils::Mksymlists;
      Mksymlists(  NAME     => $name ,
                   DL_VARS  => [ $var1, $var2, $var3 ],
                   DL_FUNCS => { $pkg1 => [ $func1, $func2 ],
                                 $pkg2 => [ $func3 ] );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  C<ExtUtils::Mksymlists> produces files used by the linker under some OSs
  during the creation of shared libraries for dynamic extensions.  It is
  normally called from a MakeMaker-generated Makefile when the extension
  is built.  The linker option file is generated by calling the function
  C<Mksymlists>, which is exported by default from C<ExtUtils::Mksymlists>.
  It takes one argument, a list of key-value pairs, in which the following
  keys are recognized:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item DLBASE
  
  This item specifies the name by which the linker knows the
  extension, which may be different from the name of the
  extension itself (for instance, some linkers add an '_' to the
  name of the extension).  If it is not specified, it is derived
  from the NAME attribute.  It is presently used only by OS2 and Win32.
  
  =item DL_FUNCS
  
  This is identical to the DL_FUNCS attribute available via MakeMaker,
  from which it is usually taken.  Its value is a reference to an
  associative array, in which each key is the name of a package, and
  each value is an a reference to an array of function names which
  should be exported by the extension.  For instance, one might say
  C<DL_FUNCS =E<gt> { Homer::Iliad =E<gt> [ qw(trojans greeks) ],
  Homer::Odyssey =E<gt> [ qw(travellers family suitors) ] }>.  The
  function names should be identical to those in the XSUB code;
  C<Mksymlists> will alter the names written to the linker option
  file to match the changes made by F<xsubpp>.  In addition, if
  none of the functions in a list begin with the string B<boot_>,
  C<Mksymlists> will add a bootstrap function for that package,
  just as xsubpp does.  (If a B<boot_E<lt>pkgE<gt>> function is
  present in the list, it is passed through unchanged.)  If
  DL_FUNCS is not specified, it defaults to the bootstrap
  function for the extension specified in NAME.
  
  =item DL_VARS
  
  This is identical to the DL_VARS attribute available via MakeMaker,
  and, like DL_FUNCS, it is usually specified via MakeMaker.  Its
  value is a reference to an array of variable names which should
  be exported by the extension.
  
  =item FILE
  
  This key can be used to specify the name of the linker option file
  (minus the OS-specific extension), if for some reason you do not
  want to use the default value, which is the last word of the NAME
  attribute (I<e.g.> for C<Tk::Canvas>, FILE defaults to C<Canvas>).
  
  =item FUNCLIST
  
  This provides an alternate means to specify function names to be
  exported from the extension.  Its value is a reference to an
  array of function names to be exported by the extension.  These
  names are passed through unaltered to the linker options file.
  Specifying a value for the FUNCLIST attribute suppresses automatic
  generation of the bootstrap function for the package. To still create
  the bootstrap name you have to specify the package name in the
  DL_FUNCS hash:
  
      Mksymlists(  NAME     => $name ,
  		 FUNCLIST => [ $func1, $func2 ],
                   DL_FUNCS => { $pkg => [] } );
  
  
  =item IMPORTS
  
  This attribute is used to specify names to be imported into the
  extension. It is currently only used by OS/2 and Win32.
  
  =item NAME
  
  This gives the name of the extension (I<e.g.> C<Tk::Canvas>) for which
  the linker option file will be produced.
  
  =back
  
  When calling C<Mksymlists>, one should always specify the NAME
  attribute.  In most cases, this is all that's necessary.  In
  the case of unusual extensions, however, the other attributes
  can be used to provide additional information to the linker.

  ExtUtils::testlib - add blib/* directories to @INC
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use ExtUtils::testlib;
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  After an extension has been built and before it is installed it may be
  desirable to test it bypassing C<make test>. By adding
  
      use ExtUtils::testlib;
  
  to a test program the intermediate directories used by C<make> are
  added to @INC.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Getopt::Long - Extended processing of command line options
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use Getopt::Long;
    my $data   = "file.dat";
    my $length = 24;
    my $verbose;
    GetOptions ("length=i" => \$length,    # numeric
                "file=s"   => \$data,      # string
                "verbose"  => \$verbose)   # flag
    or die("Error in command line arguments\n");
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  The Getopt::Long module implements an extended getopt function called
  GetOptions(). It parses the command line from C<@ARGV>, recognizing
  and removing specified options and their possible values.
  
  This function adheres to the POSIX syntax for command
  line options, with GNU extensions. In general, this means that options
  have long names instead of single letters, and are introduced with a
  double dash "--". Support for bundling of command line options, as was
  the case with the more traditional single-letter approach, is provided
  but not enabled by default.
  
  =head1 Command Line Options, an Introduction
  
  Command line operated programs traditionally take their arguments from
  the command line, for example filenames or other information that the
  program needs to know. Besides arguments, these programs often take
  command line I<options> as well. Options are not necessary for the
  program to work, hence the name 'option', but are used to modify its
  default behaviour. For example, a program could do its job quietly,
  but with a suitable option it could provide verbose information about
  what it did.
  
  Command line options come in several flavours. Historically, they are
  preceded by a single dash C<->, and consist of a single letter.
  
      -l -a -c
  
  Usually, these single-character options can be bundled:
  
      -lac
  
  Options can have values, the value is placed after the option
  character. Sometimes with whitespace in between, sometimes not:
  
      -s 24 -s24
  
  Due to the very cryptic nature of these options, another style was
  developed that used long names. So instead of a cryptic C<-l> one
  could use the more descriptive C<--long>. To distinguish between a
  bundle of single-character options and a long one, two dashes are used
  to precede the option name. Early implementations of long options used
  a plus C<+> instead. Also, option values could be specified either
  like
  
      --size=24
  
  or
  
      --size 24
  
  The C<+> form is now obsolete and strongly deprecated.
  
  =head1 Getting Started with Getopt::Long
  
  Getopt::Long is the Perl5 successor of C<newgetopt.pl>. This was the
  first Perl module that provided support for handling the new style of
  command line options, in particular long option names, hence the Perl5
  name Getopt::Long. This module also supports single-character options
  and bundling.
  
  To use Getopt::Long from a Perl program, you must include the
  following line in your Perl program:
  
      use Getopt::Long;
  
  This will load the core of the Getopt::Long module and prepare your
  program for using it. Most of the actual Getopt::Long code is not
  loaded until you really call one of its functions.
  
  In the default configuration, options names may be abbreviated to
  uniqueness, case does not matter, and a single dash is sufficient,
  even for long option names. Also, options may be placed between
  non-option arguments. See L<Configuring Getopt::Long> for more
  details on how to configure Getopt::Long.
  
  =head2 Simple options
  
  The most simple options are the ones that take no values. Their mere
  presence on the command line enables the option. Popular examples are:
  
      --all --verbose --quiet --debug
  
  Handling simple options is straightforward:
  
      my $verbose = '';	# option variable with default value (false)
      my $all = '';	# option variable with default value (false)
      GetOptions ('verbose' => \$verbose, 'all' => \$all);
  
  The call to GetOptions() parses the command line arguments that are
  present in C<@ARGV> and sets the option variable to the value C<1> if
  the option did occur on the command line. Otherwise, the option
  variable is not touched. Setting the option value to true is often
  called I<enabling> the option.
  
  The option name as specified to the GetOptions() function is called
  the option I<specification>. Later we'll see that this specification
  can contain more than just the option name. The reference to the
  variable is called the option I<destination>.
  
  GetOptions() will return a true value if the command line could be
  processed successfully. Otherwise, it will write error messages using
  die() and warn(), and return a false result.
  
  =head2 A little bit less simple options
  
  Getopt::Long supports two useful variants of simple options:
  I<negatable> options and I<incremental> options.
  
  A negatable option is specified with an exclamation mark C<!> after the
  option name:
  
      my $verbose = '';	# option variable with default value (false)
      GetOptions ('verbose!' => \$verbose);
  
  Now, using C<--verbose> on the command line will enable C<$verbose>,
  as expected. But it is also allowed to use C<--noverbose>, which will
  disable C<$verbose> by setting its value to C<0>. Using a suitable
  default value, the program can find out whether C<$verbose> is false
  by default, or disabled by using C<--noverbose>.
  
  An incremental option is specified with a plus C<+> after the
  option name:
  
      my $verbose = '';	# option variable with default value (false)
      GetOptions ('verbose+' => \$verbose);
  
  Using C<--verbose> on the command line will increment the value of
  C<$verbose>. This way the program can keep track of how many times the
  option occurred on the command line. For example, each occurrence of
  C<--verbose> could increase the verbosity level of the program.
  
  =head2 Mixing command line option with other arguments
  
  Usually programs take command line options as well as other arguments,
  for example, file names. It is good practice to always specify the
  options first, and the other arguments last. Getopt::Long will,
  however, allow the options and arguments to be mixed and 'filter out'
  all the options before passing the rest of the arguments to the
  program. To stop Getopt::Long from processing further arguments,
  insert a double dash C<--> on the command line:
  
      --size 24 -- --all
  
  In this example, C<--all> will I<not> be treated as an option, but
  passed to the program unharmed, in C<@ARGV>.
  
  =head2 Options with values
  
  For options that take values it must be specified whether the option
  value is required or not, and what kind of value the option expects.
  
  Three kinds of values are supported: integer numbers, floating point
  numbers, and strings.
  
  If the option value is required, Getopt::Long will take the
  command line argument that follows the option and assign this to the
  option variable. If, however, the option value is specified as
  optional, this will only be done if that value does not look like a
  valid command line option itself.
  
      my $tag = '';	# option variable with default value
      GetOptions ('tag=s' => \$tag);
  
  In the option specification, the option name is followed by an equals
  sign C<=> and the letter C<s>. The equals sign indicates that this
  option requires a value. The letter C<s> indicates that this value is
  an arbitrary string. Other possible value types are C<i> for integer
  values, and C<f> for floating point values. Using a colon C<:> instead
  of the equals sign indicates that the option value is optional. In
  this case, if no suitable value is supplied, string valued options get
  an empty string C<''> assigned, while numeric options are set to C<0>.
  
  =head2 Options with multiple values
  
  Options sometimes take several values. For example, a program could
  use multiple directories to search for library files:
  
      --library lib/stdlib --library lib/extlib
  
  To accomplish this behaviour, simply specify an array reference as the
  destination for the option:
  
      GetOptions ("library=s" => \@libfiles);
  
  Alternatively, you can specify that the option can have multiple
  values by adding a "@", and pass a scalar reference as the
  destination:
  
      GetOptions ("library=s@" => \$libfiles);
  
  Used with the example above, C<@libfiles> (or C<@$libfiles>) would
  contain two strings upon completion: C<"lib/stdlib"> and
  C<"lib/extlib">, in that order. It is also possible to specify that
  only integer or floating point numbers are acceptable values.
  
  Often it is useful to allow comma-separated lists of values as well as
  multiple occurrences of the options. This is easy using Perl's split()
  and join() operators:
  
      GetOptions ("library=s" => \@libfiles);
      @libfiles = split(/,/,join(',',@libfiles));
  
  Of course, it is important to choose the right separator string for
  each purpose.
  
  Warning: What follows is an experimental feature.
  
  Options can take multiple values at once, for example
  
      --coordinates 52.2 16.4 --rgbcolor 255 255 149
  
  This can be accomplished by adding a repeat specifier to the option
  specification. Repeat specifiers are very similar to the C<{...}>
  repeat specifiers that can be used with regular expression patterns.
  For example, the above command line would be handled as follows:
  
      GetOptions('coordinates=f{2}' => \@coor, 'rgbcolor=i{3}' => \@color);
  
  The destination for the option must be an array or array reference.
  
  It is also possible to specify the minimal and maximal number of
  arguments an option takes. C<foo=s{2,4}> indicates an option that
  takes at least two and at most 4 arguments. C<foo=s{1,}> indicates one
  or more values; C<foo:s{,}> indicates zero or more option values.
  
  =head2 Options with hash values
  
  If the option destination is a reference to a hash, the option will
  take, as value, strings of the form I<key>C<=>I<value>. The value will
  be stored with the specified key in the hash.
  
      GetOptions ("define=s" => \%defines);
  
  Alternatively you can use:
  
      GetOptions ("define=s%" => \$defines);
  
  When used with command line options:
  
      --define os=linux --define vendor=redhat
  
  the hash C<%defines> (or C<%$defines>) will contain two keys, C<"os">
  with value C<"linux"> and C<"vendor"> with value C<"redhat">. It is
  also possible to specify that only integer or floating point numbers
  are acceptable values. The keys are always taken to be strings.
  
  =head2 User-defined subroutines to handle options
  
  Ultimate control over what should be done when (actually: each time)
  an option is encountered on the command line can be achieved by
  designating a reference to a subroutine (or an anonymous subroutine)
  as the option destination. When GetOptions() encounters the option, it
  will call the subroutine with two or three arguments. The first
  argument is the name of the option. (Actually, it is an object that
  stringifies to the name of the option.) For a scalar or array destination,
  the second argument is the value to be stored. For a hash destination,
  the second argument is the key to the hash, and the third argument
  the value to be stored. It is up to the subroutine to store the value,
  or do whatever it thinks is appropriate.
  
  A trivial application of this mechanism is to implement options that
  are related to each other. For example:
  
      my $verbose = '';	# option variable with default value (false)
      GetOptions ('verbose' => \$verbose,
  	        'quiet'   => sub { $verbose = 0 });
  
  Here C<--verbose> and C<--quiet> control the same variable
  C<$verbose>, but with opposite values.
  
  If the subroutine needs to signal an error, it should call die() with
  the desired error message as its argument. GetOptions() will catch the
  die(), issue the error message, and record that an error result must
  be returned upon completion.
  
  If the text of the error message starts with an exclamation mark C<!>
  it is interpreted specially by GetOptions(). There is currently one
  special command implemented: C<die("!FINISH")> will cause GetOptions()
  to stop processing options, as if it encountered a double dash C<-->.
  
  In version 2.37 the first argument to the callback function was
  changed from string to object. This was done to make room for
  extensions and more detailed control. The object stringifies to the
  option name so this change should not introduce compatibility
  problems.
  
  Here is an example of how to access the option name and value from within
  a subroutine:
  
      GetOptions ('opt=i' => \&handler);
      sub handler {
          my ($opt_name, $opt_value) = @_;
          print("Option name is $opt_name and value is $opt_value\n");
      }
  
  =head2 Options with multiple names
  
  Often it is user friendly to supply alternate mnemonic names for
  options. For example C<--height> could be an alternate name for
  C<--length>. Alternate names can be included in the option
  specification, separated by vertical bar C<|> characters. To implement
  the above example:
  
      GetOptions ('length|height=f' => \$length);
  
  The first name is called the I<primary> name, the other names are
  called I<aliases>. When using a hash to store options, the key will
  always be the primary name.
  
  Multiple alternate names are possible.
  
  =head2 Case and abbreviations
  
  Without additional configuration, GetOptions() will ignore the case of
  option names, and allow the options to be abbreviated to uniqueness.
  
      GetOptions ('length|height=f' => \$length, "head" => \$head);
  
  This call will allow C<--l> and C<--L> for the length option, but
  requires a least C<--hea> and C<--hei> for the head and height options.
  
  =head2 Summary of Option Specifications
  
  Each option specifier consists of two parts: the name specification
  and the argument specification.
  
  The name specification contains the name of the option, optionally
  followed by a list of alternative names separated by vertical bar
  characters.
  
      length	      option name is "length"
      length|size|l     name is "length", aliases are "size" and "l"
  
  The argument specification is optional. If omitted, the option is
  considered boolean, a value of 1 will be assigned when the option is
  used on the command line.
  
  The argument specification can be
  
  =over 4
  
  =item !
  
  The option does not take an argument and may be negated by prefixing
  it with "no" or "no-". E.g. C<"foo!"> will allow C<--foo> (a value of
  1 will be assigned) as well as C<--nofoo> and C<--no-foo> (a value of
  0 will be assigned). If the option has aliases, this applies to the
  aliases as well.
  
  Using negation on a single letter option when bundling is in effect is
  pointless and will result in a warning.
  
  =item +
  
  The option does not take an argument and will be incremented by 1
  every time it appears on the command line. E.g. C<"more+">, when used
  with C<--more --more --more>, will increment the value three times,
  resulting in a value of 3 (provided it was 0 or undefined at first).
  
  The C<+> specifier is ignored if the option destination is not a scalar.
  
  =item = I<type> [ I<desttype> ] [ I<repeat> ]
  
  The option requires an argument of the given type. Supported types
  are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item s
  
  String. An arbitrary sequence of characters. It is valid for the
  argument to start with C<-> or C<-->.
  
  =item i
  
  Integer. An optional leading plus or minus sign, followed by a
  sequence of digits.
  
  =item o
  
  Extended integer, Perl style. This can be either an optional leading
  plus or minus sign, followed by a sequence of digits, or an octal
  string (a zero, optionally followed by '0', '1', .. '7'), or a
  hexadecimal string (C<0x> followed by '0' .. '9', 'a' .. 'f', case
  insensitive), or a binary string (C<0b> followed by a series of '0'
  and '1').
  
  =item f
  
  Real number. For example C<3.14>, C<-6.23E24> and so on.
  
  =back
  
  The I<desttype> can be C<@> or C<%> to specify that the option is
  list or a hash valued. This is only needed when the destination for
  the option value is not otherwise specified. It should be omitted when
  not needed.
  
  The I<repeat> specifies the number of values this option takes per
  occurrence on the command line. It has the format C<{> [ I<min> ] [ C<,> [ I<max> ] ] C<}>.
  
  I<min> denotes the minimal number of arguments. It defaults to 1 for
  options with C<=> and to 0 for options with C<:>, see below. Note that
  I<min> overrules the C<=> / C<:> semantics.
  
  I<max> denotes the maximum number of arguments. It must be at least
  I<min>. If I<max> is omitted, I<but the comma is not>, there is no
  upper bound to the number of argument values taken.
  
  =item : I<type> [ I<desttype> ]
  
  Like C<=>, but designates the argument as optional.
  If omitted, an empty string will be assigned to string values options,
  and the value zero to numeric options.
  
  Note that if a string argument starts with C<-> or C<-->, it will be
  considered an option on itself.
  
  =item : I<number> [ I<desttype> ]
  
  Like C<:i>, but if the value is omitted, the I<number> will be assigned.
  
  =item : + [ I<desttype> ]
  
  Like C<:i>, but if the value is omitted, the current value for the
  option will be incremented.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 Advanced Possibilities
  
  =head2 Object oriented interface
  
  Getopt::Long can be used in an object oriented way as well:
  
      use Getopt::Long;
      $p = Getopt::Long::Parser->new;
      $p->configure(...configuration options...);
      if ($p->getoptions(...options descriptions...)) ...
      if ($p->getoptionsfromarray( \@array, ...options descriptions...)) ...
  
  Configuration options can be passed to the constructor:
  
      $p = new Getopt::Long::Parser
               config => [...configuration options...];
  
  =head2 Thread Safety
  
  Getopt::Long is thread safe when using ithreads as of Perl 5.8.  It is
  I<not> thread safe when using the older (experimental and now
  obsolete) threads implementation that was added to Perl 5.005.
  
  =head2 Documentation and help texts
  
  Getopt::Long encourages the use of Pod::Usage to produce help
  messages. For example:
  
      use Getopt::Long;
      use Pod::Usage;
  
      my $man = 0;
      my $help = 0;
  
      GetOptions('help|?' => \$help, man => \$man) or pod2usage(2);
      pod2usage(1) if $help;
      pod2usage(-exitval => 0, -verbose => 2) if $man;

  =head2 Parsing options from an arbitrary array
  
  By default, GetOptions parses the options that are present in the
  global array C<@ARGV>. A special entry C<GetOptionsFromArray> can be
  used to parse options from an arbitrary array.
  
      use Getopt::Long qw(GetOptionsFromArray);
      $ret = GetOptionsFromArray(\@myopts, ...);
  
  When used like this, options and their possible values are removed
  from C<@myopts>, the global C<@ARGV> is not touched at all.
  
  The following two calls behave identically:
  
      $ret = GetOptions( ... );
      $ret = GetOptionsFromArray(\@ARGV, ... );
  
  This also means that a first argument hash reference now becomes the
  second argument:
  
      $ret = GetOptions(\%opts, ... );
      $ret = GetOptionsFromArray(\@ARGV, \%opts, ... );
  
  =head2 Parsing options from an arbitrary string
  
  A special entry C<GetOptionsFromString> can be used to parse options
  from an arbitrary string.
  
      use Getopt::Long qw(GetOptionsFromString);
      $ret = GetOptionsFromString($string, ...);
  
  The contents of the string are split into arguments using a call to
  C<Text::ParseWords::shellwords>. As with C<GetOptionsFromArray>, the
  global C<@ARGV> is not touched.
  
  It is possible that, upon completion, not all arguments in the string
  have been processed. C<GetOptionsFromString> will, when called in list
  context, return both the return status and an array reference to any
  remaining arguments:
  
      ($ret, $args) = GetOptionsFromString($string, ... );
  
  If any arguments remain, and C<GetOptionsFromString> was not called in
  list context, a message will be given and C<GetOptionsFromString> will
  return failure.
  
  As with GetOptionsFromArray, a first argument hash reference now
  becomes the second argument.
  
  =head2 Storing options values in a hash
  
  Sometimes, for example when there are a lot of options, having a
  separate variable for each of them can be cumbersome. GetOptions()
  supports, as an alternative mechanism, storing options values in a
  hash.
  
  To obtain this, a reference to a hash must be passed I<as the first
  argument> to GetOptions(). For each option that is specified on the
  command line, the option value will be stored in the hash with the
  option name as key. Options that are not actually used on the command
  line will not be put in the hash, on other words,
  C<exists($h{option})> (or defined()) can be used to test if an option
  was used. The drawback is that warnings will be issued if the program
  runs under C<use strict> and uses C<$h{option}> without testing with
  exists() or defined() first.
  
      my %h = ();
      GetOptions (\%h, 'length=i');	# will store in $h{length}
  
  For options that take list or hash values, it is necessary to indicate
  this by appending an C<@> or C<%> sign after the type:
  
      GetOptions (\%h, 'colours=s@');	# will push to @{$h{colours}}
  
  To make things more complicated, the hash may contain references to
  the actual destinations, for example:
  
      my $len = 0;
      my %h = ('length' => \$len);
      GetOptions (\%h, 'length=i');	# will store in $len
  
  This example is fully equivalent with:
  
      my $len = 0;
      GetOptions ('length=i' => \$len);	# will store in $len
  
  Any mixture is possible. For example, the most frequently used options
  could be stored in variables while all other options get stored in the
  hash:
  
      my $verbose = 0;			# frequently referred
      my $debug = 0;			# frequently referred
      my %h = ('verbose' => \$verbose, 'debug' => \$debug);
      GetOptions (\%h, 'verbose', 'debug', 'filter', 'size=i');
      if ( $verbose ) { ... }
      if ( exists $h{filter} ) { ... option 'filter' was specified ... }
  
  =head2 Bundling
  
  With bundling it is possible to set several single-character options
  at once. For example if C<a>, C<v> and C<x> are all valid options,
  
      -vax
  
  will set all three.
  
  Getopt::Long supports three styles of bundling. To enable bundling, a
  call to Getopt::Long::Configure is required.
  
  The simplest style of bundling can be enabled with:
  
      Getopt::Long::Configure ("bundling");
  
  Configured this way, single-character options can be bundled but long
  options B<must> always start with a double dash C<--> to avoid
  ambiguity. For example, when C<vax>, C<a>, C<v> and C<x> are all valid
  options,
  
      -vax
  
  will set C<a>, C<v> and C<x>, but
  
      --vax
  
  will set C<vax>.
  
  The second style of bundling lifts this restriction. It can be enabled
  with:
  
      Getopt::Long::Configure ("bundling_override");
  
  Now, C<-vax> will set the option C<vax>.
  
  In all of the above cases, option values may be inserted in the
  bundle. For example:
  
      -h24w80
  
  is equivalent to
  
      -h 24 -w 80
  
  A third style of bundling allows only values to be bundled with
  options. It can be enabled with:
  
      Getopt::Long::Configure ("bundling_values");
  
  Now, C<-h24> will set the option C<h> to C<24>, but option bundles
  like C<-vxa> and C<-h24w80> are flagged as errors.
  
  Enabling C<bundling_values> will disable the other two styles of
  bundling.
  
  When configured for bundling, single-character options are matched
  case sensitive while long options are matched case insensitive. To
  have the single-character options matched case insensitive as well,
  use:
  
      Getopt::Long::Configure ("bundling", "ignorecase_always");
  
  It goes without saying that bundling can be quite confusing.
  
  =head2 The lonesome dash
  
  Normally, a lone dash C<-> on the command line will not be considered
  an option. Option processing will terminate (unless "permute" is
  configured) and the dash will be left in C<@ARGV>.
  
  It is possible to get special treatment for a lone dash. This can be
  achieved by adding an option specification with an empty name, for
  example:
  
      GetOptions ('' => \$stdio);
  
  A lone dash on the command line will now be a legal option, and using
  it will set variable C<$stdio>.
  
  =head2 Argument callback
  
  A special option 'name' C<< <> >> can be used to designate a subroutine
  to handle non-option arguments. When GetOptions() encounters an
  argument that does not look like an option, it will immediately call this
  subroutine and passes it one parameter: the argument name. Well, actually
  it is an object that stringifies to the argument name.
  
  For example:
  
      my $width = 80;
      sub process { ... }
      GetOptions ('width=i' => \$width, '<>' => \&process);
  
  When applied to the following command line:
  
      arg1 --width=72 arg2 --width=60 arg3
  
  This will call
  C<process("arg1")> while C<$width> is C<80>,
  C<process("arg2")> while C<$width> is C<72>, and
  C<process("arg3")> while C<$width> is C<60>.
  
  This feature requires configuration option B<permute>, see section
  L<Configuring Getopt::Long>.
  
  =head1 Configuring Getopt::Long
  
  Getopt::Long can be configured by calling subroutine
  Getopt::Long::Configure(). This subroutine takes a list of quoted
  strings, each specifying a configuration option to be enabled, e.g.
  C<ignore_case>, or disabled, e.g. C<no_ignore_case>. Case does not
  matter. Multiple calls to Configure() are possible.
  
  Alternatively, as of version 2.24, the configuration options may be
  passed together with the C<use> statement:
  
      use Getopt::Long qw(:config no_ignore_case bundling);
  
  The following options are available:
  
  =over 12
  
  =item default
  
  This option causes all configuration options to be reset to their
  default values.
  
  =item posix_default
  
  This option causes all configuration options to be reset to their
  default values as if the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT had
  been set.
  
  =item auto_abbrev
  
  Allow option names to be abbreviated to uniqueness.
  Default is enabled unless environment variable
  POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set, in which case C<auto_abbrev> is disabled.
  
  =item getopt_compat
  
  Allow C<+> to start options.
  Default is enabled unless environment variable
  POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set, in which case C<getopt_compat> is disabled.
  
  =item gnu_compat
  
  C<gnu_compat> controls whether C<--opt=> is allowed, and what it should
  do. Without C<gnu_compat>, C<--opt=> gives an error. With C<gnu_compat>,
  C<--opt=> will give option C<opt> and empty value.
  This is the way GNU getopt_long() does it.
  
  =item gnu_getopt
  
  This is a short way of setting C<gnu_compat> C<bundling> C<permute>
  C<no_getopt_compat>. With C<gnu_getopt>, command line handling should be
  fully compatible with GNU getopt_long().
  
  =item require_order
  
  Whether command line arguments are allowed to be mixed with options.
  Default is disabled unless environment variable
  POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set, in which case C<require_order> is enabled.
  
  See also C<permute>, which is the opposite of C<require_order>.
  
  =item permute
  
  Whether command line arguments are allowed to be mixed with options.
  Default is enabled unless environment variable
  POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set, in which case C<permute> is disabled.
  Note that C<permute> is the opposite of C<require_order>.
  
  If C<permute> is enabled, this means that
  
      --foo arg1 --bar arg2 arg3
  
  is equivalent to
  
      --foo --bar arg1 arg2 arg3
  
  If an argument callback routine is specified, C<@ARGV> will always be
  empty upon successful return of GetOptions() since all options have been
  processed. The only exception is when C<--> is used:
  
      --foo arg1 --bar arg2 -- arg3
  
  This will call the callback routine for arg1 and arg2, and then
  terminate GetOptions() leaving C<"arg3"> in C<@ARGV>.
  
  If C<require_order> is enabled, options processing
  terminates when the first non-option is encountered.
  
      --foo arg1 --bar arg2 arg3
  
  is equivalent to
  
      --foo -- arg1 --bar arg2 arg3
  
  If C<pass_through> is also enabled, options processing will terminate
  at the first unrecognized option, or non-option, whichever comes
  first.
  
  =item bundling (default: disabled)
  
  Enabling this option will allow single-character options to be
  bundled. To distinguish bundles from long option names, long options
  I<must> be introduced with C<--> and bundles with C<->.
  
  Note that, if you have options C<a>, C<l> and C<all>, and
  auto_abbrev enabled, possible arguments and option settings are:
  
      using argument               sets option(s)
      ------------------------------------------
      -a, --a                      a
      -l, --l                      l
      -al, -la, -ala, -all,...     a, l
      --al, --all                  all
  
  The surprising part is that C<--a> sets option C<a> (due to auto
  completion), not C<all>.
  
  Note: disabling C<bundling> also disables C<bundling_override>.
  
  =item bundling_override (default: disabled)
  
  If C<bundling_override> is enabled, bundling is enabled as with
  C<bundling> but now long option names override option bundles.
  
  Note: disabling C<bundling_override> also disables C<bundling>.
  
  B<Note:> Using option bundling can easily lead to unexpected results,
  especially when mixing long options and bundles. Caveat emptor.
  
  =item ignore_case  (default: enabled)
  
  If enabled, case is ignored when matching option names. If, however,
  bundling is enabled as well, single character options will be treated
  case-sensitive.
  
  With C<ignore_case>, option specifications for options that only
  differ in case, e.g., C<"foo"> and C<"Foo">, will be flagged as
  duplicates.
  
  Note: disabling C<ignore_case> also disables C<ignore_case_always>.
  
  =item ignore_case_always (default: disabled)
  
  When bundling is in effect, case is ignored on single-character
  options also.
  
  Note: disabling C<ignore_case_always> also disables C<ignore_case>.
  
  =item auto_version (default:disabled)
  
  Automatically provide support for the B<--version> option if
  the application did not specify a handler for this option itself.
  
  Getopt::Long will provide a standard version message that includes the
  program name, its version (if $main::VERSION is defined), and the
  versions of Getopt::Long and Perl. The message will be written to
  standard output and processing will terminate.
  
  C<auto_version> will be enabled if the calling program explicitly
  specified a version number higher than 2.32 in the C<use> or
  C<require> statement.
  
  =item auto_help (default:disabled)
  
  Automatically provide support for the B<--help> and B<-?> options if
  the application did not specify a handler for this option itself.
  
  Getopt::Long will provide a help message using module L<Pod::Usage>. The
  message, derived from the SYNOPSIS POD section, will be written to
  standard output and processing will terminate.
  
  C<auto_help> will be enabled if the calling program explicitly
  specified a version number higher than 2.32 in the C<use> or
  C<require> statement.
  
  =item pass_through (default: disabled)
  
  With C<pass_through> anything that is unknown, ambiguous or supplied with
  an invalid option will not be flagged as an error. Instead the unknown
  option(s) will be passed to the catchall C<< <> >> if present, otherwise
  through to C<@ARGV>. This makes it possible to write wrapper scripts that
  process only part of the user supplied command line arguments, and pass the
  remaining options to some other program.
  
  If C<require_order> is enabled, options processing will terminate at the
  first unrecognized option, or non-option, whichever comes first and all
  remaining arguments are passed to C<@ARGV> instead of the catchall
  C<< <> >> if present.  However, if C<permute> is enabled instead, results
  can become confusing.
  
  Note that the options terminator (default C<-->), if present, will
  also be passed through in C<@ARGV>.
  
  =item prefix
  
  The string that starts options. If a constant string is not
  sufficient, see C<prefix_pattern>.
  
  =item prefix_pattern
  
  A Perl pattern that identifies the strings that introduce options.
  Default is C<--|-|\+> unless environment variable
  POSIXLY_CORRECT has been set, in which case it is C<--|->.
  
  =item long_prefix_pattern
  
  A Perl pattern that allows the disambiguation of long and short
  prefixes. Default is C<-->.
  
  Typically you only need to set this if you are using nonstandard
  prefixes and want some or all of them to have the same semantics as
  '--' does under normal circumstances.
  
  For example, setting prefix_pattern to C<--|-|\+|\/> and
  long_prefix_pattern to C<--|\/> would add Win32 style argument
  handling.
  
  =item debug (default: disabled)
  
  Enable debugging output.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 Exportable Methods
  
  =over
  
  =item VersionMessage
  
  This subroutine provides a standard version message. Its argument can be:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  A string containing the text of a message to print I<before> printing
  the standard message.
  
  =item *
  
  A numeric value corresponding to the desired exit status.
  
  =item *
  
  A reference to a hash.
  
  =back
  
  If more than one argument is given then the entire argument list is
  assumed to be a hash.  If a hash is supplied (either as a reference or
  as a list) it should contain one or more elements with the following
  keys:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item C<-message>
  
  =item C<-msg>
  
  The text of a message to print immediately prior to printing the
  program's usage message.
  
  =item C<-exitval>
  
  The desired exit status to pass to the B<exit()> function.
  This should be an integer, or else the string "NOEXIT" to
  indicate that control should simply be returned without
  terminating the invoking process.
  
  =item C<-output>
  
  A reference to a filehandle, or the pathname of a file to which the
  usage message should be written. The default is C<\*STDERR> unless the
  exit value is less than 2 (in which case the default is C<\*STDOUT>).
  
  =back
  
  You cannot tie this routine directly to an option, e.g.:
  
      GetOptions("version" => \&VersionMessage);
  
  Use this instead:
  
      GetOptions("version" => sub { VersionMessage() });
  
  =item HelpMessage
  
  This subroutine produces a standard help message, derived from the
  program's POD section SYNOPSIS using L<Pod::Usage>. It takes the same
  arguments as VersionMessage(). In particular, you cannot tie it
  directly to an option, e.g.:
  
      GetOptions("help" => \&HelpMessage);
  
  Use this instead:
  
      GetOptions("help" => sub { HelpMessage() });
  
  =back
  
  =head1 Return values and Errors
  
  Configuration errors and errors in the option definitions are
  signalled using die() and will terminate the calling program unless
  the call to Getopt::Long::GetOptions() was embedded in C<eval { ...
  }>, or die() was trapped using C<$SIG{__DIE__}>.
  
  GetOptions returns true to indicate success.
  It returns false when the function detected one or more errors during
  option parsing. These errors are signalled using warn() and can be
  trapped with C<$SIG{__WARN__}>.
  
  =head1 Legacy
  
  The earliest development of C<newgetopt.pl> started in 1990, with Perl
  version 4. As a result, its development, and the development of
  Getopt::Long, has gone through several stages. Since backward
  compatibility has always been extremely important, the current version
  of Getopt::Long still supports a lot of constructs that nowadays are
  no longer necessary or otherwise unwanted. This section describes
  briefly some of these 'features'.
  
  =head2 Default destinations
  
  When no destination is specified for an option, GetOptions will store
  the resultant value in a global variable named C<opt_>I<XXX>, where
  I<XXX> is the primary name of this option. When a program executes
  under C<use strict> (recommended), these variables must be
  pre-declared with our() or C<use vars>.
  
      our $opt_length = 0;
      GetOptions ('length=i');	# will store in $opt_length
  
  To yield a usable Perl variable, characters that are not part of the
  syntax for variables are translated to underscores. For example,
  C<--fpp-struct-return> will set the variable
  C<$opt_fpp_struct_return>. Note that this variable resides in the
  namespace of the calling program, not necessarily C<main>. For
  example:
  
      GetOptions ("size=i", "sizes=i@");
  
  with command line "-size 10 -sizes 24 -sizes 48" will perform the
  equivalent of the assignments
  
      $opt_size = 10;
      @opt_sizes = (24, 48);
  
  =head2 Alternative option starters
  
  A string of alternative option starter characters may be passed as the
  first argument (or the first argument after a leading hash reference
  argument).
  
      my $len = 0;
      GetOptions ('/', 'length=i' => $len);
  
  Now the command line may look like:
  
      /length 24 -- arg
  
  Note that to terminate options processing still requires a double dash
  C<-->.
  
  GetOptions() will not interpret a leading C<< "<>" >> as option starters
  if the next argument is a reference. To force C<< "<" >> and C<< ">" >> as
  option starters, use C<< "><" >>. Confusing? Well, B<using a starter
  argument is strongly deprecated> anyway.
  
  =head2 Configuration variables
  
  Previous versions of Getopt::Long used variables for the purpose of
  configuring. Although manipulating these variables still work, it is
  strongly encouraged to use the C<Configure> routine that was introduced
  in version 2.17. Besides, it is much easier.
  
  =head1 Tips and Techniques
  
  =head2 Pushing multiple values in a hash option
  
  Sometimes you want to combine the best of hashes and arrays. For
  example, the command line:
  
    --list add=first --list add=second --list add=third
  
  where each successive 'list add' option will push the value of add
  into array ref $list->{'add'}. The result would be like
  
    $list->{add} = [qw(first second third)];
  
  This can be accomplished with a destination routine:
  
    GetOptions('list=s%' =>
                 sub { push(@{$list{$_[1]}}, $_[2]) });
  
  =head1 Troubleshooting
  
  =head2 GetOptions does not return a false result when an option is not supplied
  
  That's why they're called 'options'.
  
  =head2 GetOptions does not split the command line correctly
  
  The command line is not split by GetOptions, but by the command line
  interpreter (CLI). On Unix, this is the shell. On Windows, it is
  COMMAND.COM or CMD.EXE. Other operating systems have other CLIs.
  
  It is important to know that these CLIs may behave different when the
  command line contains special characters, in particular quotes or
  backslashes. For example, with Unix shells you can use single quotes
  (C<'>) and double quotes (C<">) to group words together. The following
  alternatives are equivalent on Unix:
  
      "two words"
      'two words'
      two\ words
  
  In case of doubt, insert the following statement in front of your Perl
  program:
  
      print STDERR (join("|",@ARGV),"\n");
  
  to verify how your CLI passes the arguments to the program.
  
  =head2 Undefined subroutine &main::GetOptions called
  
  Are you running Windows, and did you write
  
      use GetOpt::Long;
  
  (note the capital 'O')?
  
  =head2 How do I put a "-?" option into a Getopt::Long?
  
  You can only obtain this using an alias, and Getopt::Long of at least
  version 2.13.
  
      use Getopt::Long;
      GetOptions ("help|?");    # -help and -? will both set $opt_help
  
  Other characters that can't appear in Perl identifiers are also supported
  as aliases with Getopt::Long of at least version 2.39.
  
  As of version 2.32 Getopt::Long provides auto-help, a quick and easy way
  to add the options --help and -? to your program, and handle them.
  
  See C<auto_help> in section L<Configuring Getopt::Long>.

  This version is compatible with JSON::XS B<2.34> and later.
  (Not yet compatble to JSON::XS B<3.0x>.)
  
  
  =head1 NOTE
  
  JSON::PP was earlier included in the C<JSON> distribution, but
  has since Perl 5.14 been a core module. For this reason,
  L<JSON::PP> was removed from the JSON distribution and can now
  be found also in the Perl5 repository at
  
  =over
  
  =item * L<http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git>
  
  =back
  
  (The newest JSON::PP version still exists in CPAN.)
  
  Instead, the C<JSON> distribution will include JSON::backportPP
  for backwards computability. JSON.pm should thus work as it did
  before.

  JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a simple data format.
  See to L<http://www.json.org/> and C<RFC4627>(L<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt>).
  
  This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa using either
  L<JSON::XS> or L<JSON::PP>.
  
  JSON::XS is the fastest and most proper JSON module on CPAN which must be
  compiled and installed in your environment.
  JSON::PP is a pure-Perl module which is bundled in this distribution and
  has a strong compatibility to JSON::XS.
  
  This module try to use JSON::XS by default and fail to it, use JSON::PP instead.
  So its features completely depend on JSON::XS or JSON::PP.
  
  See to L<BACKEND MODULE DECISION>.
  
  To distinguish the module name 'JSON' and the format type JSON,
  the former is quoted by CE<lt>E<gt> (its results vary with your using media),
  and the latter is left just as it is.
  
  Module name : C<JSON>
  
  Format type : JSON
  
  =head2 FEATURES
  
  =over
  
  =item * correct unicode handling
  
  This module (i.e. backend modules) knows how to handle Unicode, documents
  how and when it does so, and even documents what "correct" means.
  
  Even though there are limitations, this feature is available since Perl version 5.6.
  
  JSON::XS requires Perl 5.8.2 (but works correctly in 5.8.8 or later), so in older versions
  C<JSON> should call JSON::PP as the backend which can be used since Perl 5.005.
  
  With Perl 5.8.x JSON::PP works, but from 5.8.0 to 5.8.2, because of a Perl side problem,
  JSON::PP works slower in the versions. And in 5.005, the Unicode handling is not available.
  See to L<JSON::PP/UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS> for more information.
  
  See also to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>
  and L<JSON::XS/ENCODING/CODESET_FLAG_NOTES>.
  
  
  =item * round-trip integrity
  
  When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types supported
  by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is identical on the Perl
  level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly become "2" just because
  it looks like a number). There I<are> minor exceptions to this, read the
  L</MAPPING> section below to learn about those.
  
  
  =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
  
  There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
  and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a security
  feature).
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/FEATURES> and L<JSON::PP/FEATURES>.
  
  =item * fast
  
  This module returns a JSON::XS object itself if available.
  Compared to other JSON modules and other serialisers such as Storable,
  JSON::XS usually compares favorably in terms of speed, too.
  
  If not available, C<JSON> returns a JSON::PP object instead of JSON::XS and
  it is very slow as pure-Perl.
  
  =item * simple to use
  
  This module has both a simple functional interface as well as an
  object oriented interface interface.
  
  =item * reasonably versatile output formats
  
  You can choose between the most compact guaranteed-single-line format possible
  (nice for simple line-based protocols), a pure-ASCII format (for when your transport
  is not 8-bit clean, still supports the whole Unicode range), or a pretty-printed
  format (for when you want to read that stuff). Or you can combine those features
  in whatever way you like.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  Some documents are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE>.
  C<to_json> and C<from_json> are additional functions.
  
  =head2 encode_json
  
      $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $json_text = JSON->new->utf8->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  =head2 decode_json
  
      $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON->new->utf8->decode($json_text)
  
  
  =head2 to_json
  
     $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a json string.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
     $json_text = JSON->new->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Takes a hash reference as the second.
  
     $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar, $flag_hashref)
  
  So,
  
     $json_text = to_json($perl_scalar, {utf8 => 1, pretty => 1})
  
  equivalent to:
  
     $json_text = JSON->new->utf8(1)->pretty(1)->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  If you want to write a modern perl code which communicates to outer world,
  you should use C<encode_json> (supposed that JSON data are encoded in UTF-8).
  
  =head2 from_json
  
     $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<to_json>: expects a json string and tries
  to parse it, returning the resulting reference.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON->decode($json_text)
  
  Takes a hash reference as the second.
  
      $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text, $flag_hashref)
  
  So,
  
      $perl_scalar = from_json($json_text, {utf8 => 1})
  
  equivalent to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON->new->utf8(1)->decode($json_text)
  
  If you want to write a modern perl code which communicates to outer world,
  you should use C<decode_json> (supposed that JSON data are encoded in UTF-8).
  
  =head2 JSON::is_bool
  
      $is_boolean = JSON::is_bool($scalar)
  
  Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::true or
  JSON::false, two constants that act like C<1> and C<0> respectively
  and are also used to represent JSON C<true> and C<false> in Perl strings.
  
  =head2 JSON::true
  
  Returns JSON true value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::false
  
  Returns JSON false value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::null
  
  Returns C<undef>.
  
  See L<MAPPING>, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to
  Perl.
  
  =head1 HOW DO I DECODE A DATA FROM OUTER AND ENCODE TO OUTER
  
  This section supposes that your perl version is 5.8 or later.
  
  If you know a JSON text from an outer world - a network, a file content, and so on,
  is encoded in UTF-8, you should use C<decode_json> or C<JSON> module object
  with C<utf8> enable. And the decoded result will contain UNICODE characters.
  
    # from network
    my $json        = JSON->new->utf8;
    my $json_text   = CGI->new->param( 'json_data' );
    my $perl_scalar = $json->decode( $json_text );
    
    # from file content
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    $json_text   = <$fh>;
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( $json_text );
  
  If an outer data is not encoded in UTF-8, firstly you should C<decode> it.
  
    use Encode;
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    my $encoding = 'cp932';
    my $unicode_json_text = decode( $encoding, <$fh> ); # UNICODE
    
    # or you can write the below code.
    #
    # open( my $fh, "<:encoding($encoding)", 'json.data' );
    # $unicode_json_text = <$fh>;
  
  In this case, C<$unicode_json_text> is of course UNICODE string.
  So you B<cannot> use C<decode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable or C<from_json>.
  
    $perl_scalar = $json->utf8(0)->decode( $unicode_json_text );
    # or
    $perl_scalar = from_json( $unicode_json_text );
  
  Or C<encode 'utf8'> and C<decode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( encode( 'utf8', $unicode_json_text ) );
    # this way is not efficient.
  
  And now, you want to convert your C<$perl_scalar> into JSON data and
  send it to an outer world - a network or a file content, and so on.
  
  Your data usually contains UNICODE strings and you want the converted data to be encoded
  in UTF-8, you should use C<encode_json> or C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  
    print encode_json( $perl_scalar ); # to a network? file? or display?
    # or
    print $json->utf8->encode( $perl_scalar );
  
  If C<$perl_scalar> does not contain UNICODE but C<$encoding>-encoded strings
  for some reason, then its characters are regarded as B<latin1> for perl
  (because it does not concern with your $encoding).
  You B<cannot> use C<encode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable or C<to_json>.
  Note that the resulted text is a UNICODE string but no problem to print it.
  
    # $perl_scalar contains $encoding encoded string values
    $unicode_json_text = $json->utf8(0)->encode( $perl_scalar );
    # or 
    $unicode_json_text = to_json( $perl_scalar );
    # $unicode_json_text consists of characters less than 0x100
    print $unicode_json_text;
  
  Or C<decode $encoding> all string values and C<encode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar->{ foo } = decode( $encoding, $perl_scalar->{ foo } );
    # ... do it to each string values, then encode_json
    $json_text = encode_json( $perl_scalar );
  
  This method is a proper way but probably not efficient.
  
  See to L<Encode>, L<perluniintro>.
  
  
  =head1 COMMON OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
  
  =head2 new
  
      $json = JSON->new
  
  Returns a new C<JSON> object inherited from either JSON::XS or JSON::PP
  that can be used to de/encode JSON strings.
  
  All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON->new->utf8->space_after->encode({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =head2 ascii
  
      $json = $json->ascii([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will not generate characters outside
  the code range 0..127. Any Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either
  a single \uXXXX or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence, as per RFC4627.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters unless
  required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results in a faster and more compact format.
  
  This feature depends on the used Perl version and environment.
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS> if the backend is PP.
  
    JSON->new->ascii(1)->encode([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =head2 latin1
  
      $json = $json->latin1([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the resulting JSON
  text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters outside the code range 0..255.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters
  unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
    JSON->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  =head2 utf8
  
      $json = $json->utf8([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the JSON result
  into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the decode method expects to be handled
  an UTF-8-encoded string. Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any
  characters outside the range 0..255, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O.
  
  In future versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16 and UTF-32
  encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will return the JSON string as a (non-encoded)
  Unicode string, while decode expects thus a Unicode string. Any decoding or encoding
  (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::XS->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::XS->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS> if the backend is PP.
  
  
  =head2 pretty
  
      $json = $json->pretty([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> (and in the future possibly more) flags in one call to
  generate the most readable (or most compact) form possible.
  
  Equivalent to:
  
     $json->indent->space_before->space_after
  
  The indent space length is three and JSON::XS cannot change the indent
  space length.
  
  =head2 indent
  
      $json = $json->indent([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will use a multiline
  format as output, putting every array member or object/hash key-value pair
  into its own line, identifying them properly.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, no newlines or indenting will be produced, and the
  resulting JSON text is guaranteed not to contain any C<newlines>.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  The indent space length is three.
  With JSON::PP, you can also access C<indent_length> to change indent space length.
  
  
  =head2 space_before
  
      $json = $json->space_before([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  
  =head2 space_after
  
      $json = $json->space_after([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  
  =head2 relaxed
  
      $json = $json->relaxed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...
    ]
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 canonical
  
      $json = $json->canonical([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  =head2 allow_nonref
  
      $json = $json->allow_nonref([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
     JSON->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =head2 allow_unknown
  
      $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode" will *not* throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON "null" value.
  Note that blessed objects are not included here and are handled
  separately by c<allow_nonref>.
  
  If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect "decode" in any way, and it is
  recommended to leave it off unless you know your communications
  partner.
  
  =head2 allow_blessed
  
      $json = $json->allow_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference. Instead, the value of the
  B<convert_blessed> option will decide whether C<null> (C<convert_blessed>
  disabled or no C<TO_JSON> method found) or a representation of the
  object (C<convert_blessed> enabled and C<TO_JSON> method found) is being
  encoded. Has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object.
  
  
  =head2 convert_blessed
  
      $json = $json->convert_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context
  and the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object. If no
  C<TO_JSON> method is found, the value of C<allow_blessed> will decide what
  to do.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with the C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  This setting does not yet influence C<decode> in any way.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<allow_blessed> setting will decide what
  to do when a blessed object is found.
  
  =over
  
  =item convert_blessed_universally mode
  
  If use C<JSON> with C<-convert_blessed_universally>, the C<UNIVERSAL::TO_JSON>
  subroutine is defined as the below code:
  
     *UNIVERSAL::TO_JSON = sub {
         my $b_obj = B::svref_2object( $_[0] );
         return    $b_obj->isa('B::HV') ? { %{ $_[0] } }
                 : $b_obj->isa('B::AV') ? [ @{ $_[0] } ]
                 : undef
                 ;
     }
  
  This will cause that C<encode> method converts simple blessed objects into
  JSON objects as non-blessed object.
  
     JSON -convert_blessed_universally;
     $json->allow_blessed->convert_blessed->encode( $blessed_object )
  
  This feature is experimental and may be removed in the future.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 filter_json_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_object([$coderef])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument passed to the coderef
  is a reference to the newly-created hash. If the code references returns
  a single scalar (which need not be a reference), this value
  (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid aliasing) is inserted into the
  deserialised data structure. If it returns an empty list
  (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the original deserialised
  hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]'); # the given subroutine takes a hash reference.
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  
  =head2 filter_json_single_key_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object($key [=> $coderef])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  
  =head2 shrink
  
      $json = $json->shrink([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  With JSON::XS, this flag resizes strings generated by either
  C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible. This can save
  memory when your JSON texts are either very very long or you have many
  short strings. It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form
  if possible: perl stores strings internally either in an encoding called
  UTF-X or in octet-form. The latter cannot store everything but uses less
  space in general (and some buggy Perl or C code might even rely on that
  internal representation being used).
  
  With JSON::PP, it is noop about resizing strings but tries
  C<utf8::downgrade> to the returned string by C<encode>. See to L<utf8>.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE> and L<JSON::PP/METHODS>.
  
  =head2 max_depth
  
      $json = $json->max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])
      
      $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  Note that nesting is implemented by recursion in C. The default value has
  been chosen to be as large as typical operating systems allow without
  crashing. (JSON::XS)
  
  With JSON::PP as the backend, when a large value (100 or more) was set and
  it de/encodes a deep nested object/text, it may raise a warning
  'Deep recursion on subroutine' at the perl runtime phase.
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 max_size
  
      $json = $json->max_size([$maximum_string_size])
      
      $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS>, below, for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 encode
  
      $json_text = $json->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure (a simple scalar or a reference
  to a hash or array) to its JSON representation. Simple scalars will be
  converted into JSON string or number sequences, while references to arrays
  become JSON arrays and references to hashes become JSON objects. Undefined
  Perl values (e.g. C<undef>) become JSON C<null> values.
  References to the integers C<0> and C<1> are converted into C<true> and C<false>.
  
  =head2 decode
  
      $perl_scalar = $json->decode($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  JSON numbers and strings become simple Perl scalars. JSON arrays become
  Perl arrayrefs and JSON objects become Perl hashrefs. C<true> becomes
  C<1> (C<JSON::true>), C<false> becomes C<0> (C<JSON::false>) and
  C<null> becomes C<undef>.
  
  =head2 decode_prefix
  
      ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
     JSON->new->decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
     => ([], 3)
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>
  
  =head2 property
  
      $boolean = $json->property($property_name)
  
  Returns a boolean value about above some properties.
  
  The available properties are C<ascii>, C<latin1>, C<utf8>,
  C<indent>,C<space_before>, C<space_after>, C<relaxed>, C<canonical>,
  C<allow_nonref>, C<allow_unknown>, C<allow_blessed>, C<convert_blessed>,
  C<shrink>, C<max_depth> and C<max_size>.
  
     $boolean = $json->property('utf8');
      => 0
     $json->utf8;
     $boolean = $json->property('utf8');
      => 1
  
  Sets the property with a given boolean value.
  
      $json = $json->property($property_name => $boolean);
  
  With no argument, it returns all the above properties as a hash reference.
  
      $flag_hashref = $json->property();
  
  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  Most of this section are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING>.
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON texts.
  This module does allow you to parse a JSON stream incrementally.
  It does so by accumulating text until it has a full JSON object, which
  it then can decode. This process is similar to using C<decode_prefix>
  to see if a full JSON object is available, but is much more efficient
  (and can be implemented with a minimum of method calls).
  
  The backend module will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect parenthesis
  mismatches. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =head2 incr_parse
  
      $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
      
      $obj_or_undef = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
      
      @obj_or_empty = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the erroneous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
  an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
  case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
  lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return them.
  
      my @objs = JSON->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =head2 incr_text
  
      $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
      $json->incr_text =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
  
  In Perl 5.005, C<lvalue> attribute is not available.
  You must write codes like the below:
  
      $string = $json->incr_text;
      $string =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
      $json->incr_text( $string );
  
  =head2 incr_skip
  
      $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove the
  parsed text from the input buffer. This is useful after C<incr_parse>
  died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser state is left
  unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the parse state.
  
  =head2 incr_reset
  
      $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING> for examples.
  
  
  =head1 JSON::PP SUPPORT METHODS
  
  The below methods are JSON::PP own methods, so when C<JSON> works
  with JSON::PP (i.e. the created object is a JSON::PP object), available.
  See to L<JSON::PP/JSON::PP OWN METHODS> in detail.
  
  If you use C<JSON> with additional C<-support_by_pp>, some methods
  are available even with JSON::XS. See to L<USE PP FEATURES EVEN THOUGH XS BACKEND>.
  
     BEING { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND} = 'JSON::XS' }
     
     use JSON -support_by_pp;
     
     my $json = JSON->new;
     $json->allow_nonref->escape_slash->encode("/");
  
     # functional interfaces too.
     print to_json(["/"], {escape_slash => 1});
     print from_json('["foo"]', {utf8 => 1});
  
  If you do not want to all functions but C<-support_by_pp>,
  use C<-no_export>.
  
     use JSON -support_by_pp, -no_export;
     # functional interfaces are not exported.
  
  =head2 allow_singlequote
  
      $json = $json->allow_singlequote([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  any JSON strings quoted by single quotations that are invalid JSON
  format.
  
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({"foo":'bar'});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':"bar"});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':'bar'});
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
  =head2 allow_barekey
  
      $json = $json->allow_barekey([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  bare keys of JSON object that are invalid JSON format.
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
      $json->allow_barekey->decode('{foo:"bar"}');
  
  =head2 allow_bignum
  
      $json = $json->allow_bignum([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will convert
  the big integer Perl cannot handle as integer into a L<Math::BigInt>
  object and convert a floating number (any) into a L<Math::BigFloat>.
  
  On the contrary, C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers with C<allow_blessed> enable.
  
     $json->allow_nonref->allow_blessed->allow_bignum;
     $bigfloat = $json->decode('2.000000000000000000000000001');
     print $json->encode($bigfloat);
     # => 2.000000000000000000000000001
  
  See to L<MAPPING> about the conversion of JSON number.
  
  =head2 loose
  
      $json = $json->loose([$enable])
  
  The unescaped [\x00-\x1f\x22\x2f\x5c] strings are invalid in JSON strings
  and the module doesn't allow to C<decode> to these (except for \x2f).
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode>  will accept these
  unescaped strings.
  
      $json->loose->decode(qq|["abc
                                     def"]|);
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
  
  =head2 escape_slash
  
      $json = $json->escape_slash([$enable])
  
  According to JSON Grammar, I<slash> (U+002F) is escaped. But by default
  JSON backend modules encode strings without escaping slash.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will escape slashes.
  
  =head2 indent_length
  
      $json = $json->indent_length($length)
  
  With JSON::XS, The indent space length is 3 and cannot be changed.
  With JSON::PP, it sets the indent space length with the given $length.
  The default is 3. The acceptable range is 0 to 15.
  
  =head2 sort_by
  
      $json = $json->sort_by($function_name)
      $json = $json->sort_by($subroutine_ref)
  
  If $function_name or $subroutine_ref are set, its sort routine are used.
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by(sub { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b })->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by('own_sort')->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     sub JSON::PP::own_sort { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b }
  
  As the sorting routine runs in the JSON::PP scope, the given
  subroutine name and the special variables C<$a>, C<$b> will begin
  with 'JSON::PP::'.
  
  If $integer is set, then the effect is same as C<canonical> on.
  
  See to L<JSON::PP/JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
  
  =head1 MAPPING
  
  This section is copied from JSON::XS and modified to C<JSON>.
  JSON::XS and JSON::PP mapping mechanisms are almost equivalent.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING>.
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserver object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, C<JSON> will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded to a JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, C<JSON> only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the least significant bit.
  
  If the backend is JSON::PP and C<allow_bignum> is enable, the big integers 
  and the numeric can be optionally converted into L<Math::BigInt> and
  L<Math::BigFloat> objects.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<JSON::true> and C<JSON::false>,
  respectively. They are overloaded to act almost exactly like the numbers
  C<1> and C<0>. You can check whether a scalar is a JSON boolean by using
  the C<JSON::is_bool> function.
  
     print JSON::true + 1;
      => 1
  
     ok(JSON::true eq  '1');
     ok(JSON::true == 1);
  
  C<JSON> will install these missing overloading features to the backend modules.
  
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  C<JSON::null> returns C<undef>.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent ordering
  in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded in a
  pseudo-random order that can change between runs of the same program but
  stays generally the same within a single run of a program. C<JSON>
  optionally sort the hash keys (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so
  the same data structure will serialise to the same JSON text (given same
  settings and version of JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead
  and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text
  against another for equality.
  
  In future, the ordered object feature will be added to JSON::PP using C<tie> mechanism.
  
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON. You can
  also use C<JSON::false> and C<JSON::true> to improve readability.
  
     to_json [\0,JSON::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item JSON::true, JSON::false, JSON::null
  
  These special values become JSON true and JSON false values,
  respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0> directly if you want.
  
  JSON::null returns C<undef>.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON. See the
  C<allow_blessed> and C<convert_blessed> methods on various options on
  how to deal with this: basically, you can choose between throwing an
  exception, encoding the reference as if it weren't blessed, or provide
  your own serialiser method.
  
  With C<convert_blessed_universally> mode,  C<encode> converts blessed
  hash references or blessed array references (contains other blessed references)
  into JSON members and arrays.
  
     use JSON -convert_blessed_universally;
     JSON->new->allow_blessed->convert_blessed->encode( $blessed_object );
  
  See to L<convert_blessed>.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS and JSON::PP will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
  
  You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
  
  You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways.
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  =item Big Number
  
  If the backend is JSON::PP and C<allow_bignum> is enable, 
  C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers.
  
  
  =back
  
  =head1 JSON and ECMAscript
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/JSON and ECMAscript>.
  
  =head1 JSON and YAML
  
  JSON is not a subset of YAML.
  See to L<JSON::XS/JSON and YAML>.
  
  
  =head1 BACKEND MODULE DECISION
  
  When you use C<JSON>, C<JSON> tries to C<use> JSON::XS. If this call failed, it will
  C<uses> JSON::PP. The required JSON::XS version is I<2.2> or later.
  
  The C<JSON> constructor method returns an object inherited from the backend module,
  and JSON::XS object is a blessed scalar reference while JSON::PP is a blessed hash
  reference.
  
  So, your program should not depend on the backend module, especially
  returned objects should not be modified.
  
   my $json = JSON->new; # XS or PP?
   $json->{stash} = 'this is xs object'; # this code may raise an error!
  
  To check the backend module, there are some methods - C<backend>, C<is_pp> and C<is_xs>.
  
    JSON->backend; # 'JSON::XS' or 'JSON::PP'
    
    JSON->backend->is_pp: # 0 or 1
    
    JSON->backend->is_xs: # 1 or 0
    
    $json->is_xs; # 1 or 0
    
    $json->is_pp; # 0 or 1
  
  
  If you set an environment variable C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND>, the calling action will be changed.
  
  =over
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 0 or PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::PP'
  
  Always use JSON::PP
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND == 1 or PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::XS,JSON::PP'
  
  (The default) Use compiled JSON::XS if it is properly compiled & installed,
  otherwise use JSON::PP.
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND == 2 or PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::XS'
  
  Always use compiled JSON::XS, die if it isn't properly compiled & installed.
  
  =item PERL_JSON_BACKEND = 'JSON::backportPP'
  
  Always use JSON::backportPP.
  JSON::backportPP is JSON::PP back port module.
  C<JSON> includes JSON::backportPP instead of JSON::PP.
  
  =back
  
  These ideas come from L<DBI::PurePerl> mechanism.
  
  example:
  
   BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND} = 'JSON::PP' }
   use JSON; # always uses JSON::PP
  
  In future, it may be able to specify another module.
  
  =head1 USE PP FEATURES EVEN THOUGH XS BACKEND
  
  Many methods are available with either JSON::XS or JSON::PP and
  when the backend module is JSON::XS, if any JSON::PP specific (i.e. JSON::XS unsupported)
  method is called, it will C<warn> and be noop.
  
  But If you C<use> C<JSON> passing the optional string C<-support_by_pp>,
  it makes a part of those unsupported methods available.
  This feature is achieved by using JSON::PP in C<de/encode>.
  
     BEGIN { $ENV{PERL_JSON_BACKEND} = 2 } # with JSON::XS
     use JSON -support_by_pp;
     my $json = JSON->new;
     $json->allow_nonref->escape_slash->encode("/");
  
  At this time, the returned object is a C<JSON::Backend::XS::Supportable>
  object (re-blessed XS object), and  by checking JSON::XS unsupported flags
  in de/encoding, can support some unsupported methods - C<loose>, C<allow_bignum>,
  C<allow_barekey>, C<allow_singlequote>, C<escape_slash> and C<indent_length>.
  
  When any unsupported methods are not enable, C<XS de/encode> will be
  used as is. The switch is achieved by changing the symbolic tables.
  
  C<-support_by_pp> is effective only when the backend module is JSON::XS
  and it makes the de/encoding speed down a bit.
  
  See to L<JSON::PP SUPPORT METHODS>.
  
  =head1 INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES TO OLD VERSION
  
  There are big incompatibility between new version (2.00) and old (1.xx).
  If you use old C<JSON> 1.xx in your code, please check it.
  
  See to L<Transition ways from 1.xx to 2.xx.>
  
  =over
  
  =item jsonToObj and objToJson are obsoleted.
  
  Non Perl-style name C<jsonToObj> and C<objToJson> are obsoleted
  (but not yet deleted from the source).
  If you use these functions in your code, please replace them
  with C<from_json> and C<to_json>.
  
  
  =item Global variables are no longer available.
  
  C<JSON> class variables - C<$JSON::AUTOCONVERT>, C<$JSON::BareKey>, etc...
  - are not available any longer.
  Instead, various features can be used through object methods.
  
  
  =item Package JSON::Converter and JSON::Parser are deleted.
  
  Now C<JSON> bundles with JSON::PP which can handle JSON more properly than them.
  
  =item Package JSON::NotString is deleted.
  
  There was C<JSON::NotString> class which represents JSON value C<true>, C<false>, C<null>
  and numbers. It was deleted and replaced by C<JSON::Boolean>.
  
  C<JSON::Boolean> represents C<true> and C<false>.
  
  C<JSON::Boolean> does not represent C<null>.
  
  C<JSON::null> returns C<undef>.
  
  C<JSON> makes L<JSON::XS::Boolean> and L<JSON::PP::Boolean> is-a relation
  to L<JSON::Boolean>.
  
  =item function JSON::Number is obsoleted.
  
  C<JSON::Number> is now needless because JSON::XS and JSON::PP have
  round-trip integrity.
  
  =item JSONRPC modules are deleted.
  
  Perl implementation of JSON-RPC protocol - C<JSONRPC >, C<JSONRPC::Transport::HTTP>
  and C<Apache::JSONRPC > are deleted in this distribution.
  Instead of them, there is L<JSON::RPC> which supports JSON-RPC protocol version 1.1.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Transition ways from 1.xx to 2.xx.
  
  You should set C<suport_by_pp> mode firstly, because
  it is always successful for the below codes even with JSON::XS.
  
      use JSON -support_by_pp;
  
  =over
  
  =item Exported jsonToObj (simple)
  
    from_json($json_text);
  
  =item Exported objToJson (simple)
  
    to_json($perl_scalar);
  
  =item Exported jsonToObj (advanced)
  
    $flags = {allow_barekey => 1, allow_singlequote => 1};
    from_json($json_text, $flags);
  
  equivalent to:
  
    $JSON::BareKey = 1;
    $JSON::QuotApos = 1;
    jsonToObj($json_text);
  
  =item Exported objToJson (advanced)
  
    $flags = {allow_blessed => 1, allow_barekey => 1};
    to_json($perl_scalar, $flags);
  
  equivalent to:
  
    $JSON::BareKey = 1;
    objToJson($perl_scalar);
  
  =item jsonToObj as object method
  
    $json->decode($json_text);
  
  =item objToJson as object method
  
    $json->encode($perl_scalar);
  
  =item new method with parameters
  
  The C<new> method in 2.x takes any parameters no longer.
  You can set parameters instead;
  
     $json = JSON->new->pretty;
  
  =item $JSON::Pretty, $JSON::Indent, $JSON::Delimiter
  
  If C<indent> is enable, that means C<$JSON::Pretty> flag set. And
  C<$JSON::Delimiter> was substituted by C<space_before> and C<space_after>.
  In conclusion:
  
     $json->indent->space_before->space_after;
  
  Equivalent to:
  
    $json->pretty;
  
  To change indent length, use C<indent_length>.
  
  (Only with JSON::PP, if C<-support_by_pp> is not used.)
  
    $json->pretty->indent_length(2)->encode($perl_scalar);
  
  =item $JSON::BareKey
  
  (Only with JSON::PP, if C<-support_by_pp> is not used.)
  
    $json->allow_barekey->decode($json_text)
  
  =item $JSON::ConvBlessed
  
  use C<-convert_blessed_universally>. See to L<convert_blessed>.
  
  =item $JSON::QuotApos
  
  (Only with JSON::PP, if C<-support_by_pp> is not used.)
  
    $json->allow_singlequote->decode($json_text)
  
  =item $JSON::SingleQuote
  
  Disable. C<JSON> does not make such a invalid JSON string any longer.
  
  =item $JSON::KeySort
  
    $json->canonical->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  This is the ascii sort.
  
  If you want to use with your own sort routine, check the C<sort_by> method.
  
  (Only with JSON::PP, even if C<-support_by_pp> is used currently.)
  
    $json->sort_by($sort_routine_ref)->encode($perl_scalar)
   
    $json->sort_by(sub { $JSON::PP::a <=> $JSON::PP::b })->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Can't access C<$a> and C<$b> but C<$JSON::PP::a> and C<$JSON::PP::b>.
  
  =item $JSON::SkipInvalid
  
    $json->allow_unknown
  
  =item $JSON::AUTOCONVERT
  
  Needless. C<JSON> backend modules have the round-trip integrity.
  
  =item $JSON::UTF8
  
  Needless because C<JSON> (JSON::XS/JSON::PP) sets
  the UTF8 flag on properly.
  
      # With UTF8-flagged strings
  
      $json->allow_nonref;
      $str = chr(1000); # UTF8-flagged
  
      $json_text  = $json->utf8(0)->encode($str);
      utf8::is_utf8($json_text);
      # true
      $json_text  = $json->utf8(1)->encode($str);
      utf8::is_utf8($json_text);
      # false
  
      $str = '"' . chr(1000) . '"'; # UTF8-flagged
  
      $perl_scalar  = $json->utf8(0)->decode($str);
      utf8::is_utf8($perl_scalar);
      # true
      $perl_scalar  = $json->utf8(1)->decode($str);
      # died because of 'Wide character in subroutine'
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>.
  
  =item $JSON::UnMapping
  
  Disable. See to L<MAPPING>.
  
  =item $JSON::SelfConvert
  
  This option was deleted.
  Instead of it, if a given blessed object has the C<TO_JSON> method,
  C<TO_JSON> will be executed with C<convert_blessed>.
  
    $json->convert_blessed->encode($blessed_hashref_or_arrayref)
    # if need, call allow_blessed
  
  Note that it was C<toJson> in old version, but now not C<toJson> but C<TO_JSON>.

  =head1 VERSION
  
      2.27202
  
  L<JSON::XS> 2.27 (~2.30) compatible.
  
  =head1 NOTE
  
  JSON::PP had been inculded in JSON distribution (CPAN module).
  It was a perl core module in Perl 5.14.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module is L<JSON::XS> compatible pure Perl module.
  (Perl 5.8 or later is recommended)
  
  JSON::XS is the fastest and most proper JSON module on CPAN.
  It is written by Marc Lehmann in C, so must be compiled and
  installed in the used environment.
  
  JSON::PP is a pure-Perl module and has compatibility to JSON::XS.
  
  
  =head2 FEATURES
  
  =over
  
  =item * correct unicode handling
  
  This module knows how to handle Unicode (depending on Perl version).
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL> and L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  
  =item * round-trip integrity
  
  When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types supported
  by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is identical on the Perl
  level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly become "2" just because
  it looks like a number). There I<are> minor exceptions to this, read the
  MAPPING section below to learn about those.
  
  
  =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
  
  There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
  and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a security feature).
  But when some options are set, loose chcking features are available.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  Some documents are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE>.
  
  =head2 encode_json
  
      $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $json_text = JSON::PP->new->utf8->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  =head2 decode_json
  
      $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON::PP->new->utf8->decode($json_text)
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::is_bool
  
      $is_boolean = JSON::PP::is_bool($scalar)
  
  Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::PP::true or
  JSON::PP::false, two constants that act like C<1> and C<0> respectively
  and are also used to represent JSON C<true> and C<false> in Perl strings.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::true
  
  Returns JSON true value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::false
  
  Returns JSON false value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::null
  
  Returns C<undef>.
  
  See L<MAPPING>, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to
  Perl.
  
  
  =head1 HOW DO I DECODE A DATA FROM OUTER AND ENCODE TO OUTER
  
  This section supposes that your perl vresion is 5.8 or later.
  
  If you know a JSON text from an outer world - a network, a file content, and so on,
  is encoded in UTF-8, you should use C<decode_json> or C<JSON> module object
  with C<utf8> enable. And the decoded result will contain UNICODE characters.
  
    # from network
    my $json        = JSON::PP->new->utf8;
    my $json_text   = CGI->new->param( 'json_data' );
    my $perl_scalar = $json->decode( $json_text );
    
    # from file content
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    $json_text   = <$fh>;
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( $json_text );
  
  If an outer data is not encoded in UTF-8, firstly you should C<decode> it.
  
    use Encode;
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    my $encoding = 'cp932';
    my $unicode_json_text = decode( $encoding, <$fh> ); # UNICODE
    
    # or you can write the below code.
    #
    # open( my $fh, "<:encoding($encoding)", 'json.data' );
    # $unicode_json_text = <$fh>;
  
  In this case, C<$unicode_json_text> is of course UNICODE string.
  So you B<cannot> use C<decode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
  
    $perl_scalar = $json->utf8(0)->decode( $unicode_json_text );
  
  Or C<encode 'utf8'> and C<decode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( encode( 'utf8', $unicode_json_text ) );
    # this way is not efficient.
  
  And now, you want to convert your C<$perl_scalar> into JSON data and
  send it to an outer world - a network or a file content, and so on.
  
  Your data usually contains UNICODE strings and you want the converted data to be encoded
  in UTF-8, you should use C<encode_json> or C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  
    print encode_json( $perl_scalar ); # to a network? file? or display?
    # or
    print $json->utf8->encode( $perl_scalar );
  
  If C<$perl_scalar> does not contain UNICODE but C<$encoding>-encoded strings
  for some reason, then its characters are regarded as B<latin1> for perl
  (because it does not concern with your $encoding).
  You B<cannot> use C<encode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
  Note that the resulted text is a UNICODE string but no problem to print it.
  
    # $perl_scalar contains $encoding encoded string values
    $unicode_json_text = $json->utf8(0)->encode( $perl_scalar );
    # $unicode_json_text consists of characters less than 0x100
    print $unicode_json_text;
  
  Or C<decode $encoding> all string values and C<encode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar->{ foo } = decode( $encoding, $perl_scalar->{ foo } );
    # ... do it to each string values, then encode_json
    $json_text = encode_json( $perl_scalar );
  
  This method is a proper way but probably not efficient.
  
  See to L<Encode>, L<perluniintro>.
  
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  Basically, check to L<JSON> or L<JSON::XS>.
  
  =head2 new
  
      $json = JSON::PP->new
  
  Rturns a new JSON::PP object that can be used to de/encode JSON
  strings.
  
  All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON::PP->new->utf8->space_after->encode({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =head2 ascii
  
      $json = $json->ascii([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will not generate characters outside
  the code range 0..127. Any Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either
  a single \uXXXX or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence, as per RFC4627.
  (See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>).
  
  In Perl 5.005, there is no character having high value (more than 255).
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters unless
  required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results in a faster and more compact format.
  
    JSON::PP->new->ascii(1)->encode([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =head2 latin1
  
      $json = $json->latin1([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the resulting JSON
  text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters outside the code range 0..255.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters
  unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
    JSON::XS->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  =head2 utf8
  
      $json = $json->utf8([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the JSON result
  into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the decode method expects to be handled
  an UTF-8-encoded string. Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any
  characters outside the range 0..255, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O.
  
  (In Perl 5.005, any character outside the range 0..255 does not exist.
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.)
  
  In future versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16 and UTF-32
  encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will return the JSON string as a (non-encoded)
  Unicode string, while decode expects thus a Unicode string. Any decoding or encoding
  (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::PP->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::PP->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  
  =head2 pretty
  
      $json = $json->pretty([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> flags in one call to generate the most readable
  (or most compact) form possible.
  
  Equivalent to:
  
     $json->indent->space_before->space_after
  
  =head2 indent
  
      $json = $json->indent([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  The default indent space length is three.
  You can use C<indent_length> to change the length.
  
  =head2 space_before
  
      $json = $json->space_before([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  =head2 space_after
  
      $json = $json->space_after([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  =head2 relaxed
  
      $json = $json->relaxed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...
    ]
  
  =back
  
  =head2 canonical
  
      $json = $json->canonical([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  If you want your own sorting routine, you can give a code referece
  or a subroutine name to C<sort_by>. See to C<JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
  
  =head2 allow_nonref
  
      $json = $json->allow_nonref([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
     JSON::PP->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =head2 allow_unknown
  
      $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode" will *not* throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON "null" value.
  Note that blessed objects are not included here and are handled
  separately by c<allow_nonref>.
  
  If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect "decode" in any way, and it is
  recommended to leave it off unless you know your communications
  partner.
  
  =head2 allow_blessed
  
      $json = $json->allow_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference. Instead, the value of the
  B<convert_blessed> option will decide whether C<null> (C<convert_blessed>
  disabled or no C<TO_JSON> method found) or a representation of the
  object (C<convert_blessed> enabled and C<TO_JSON> method found) is being
  encoded. Has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object.
  
  =head2 convert_blessed
  
      $json = $json->convert_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context
  and the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object. If no
  C<TO_JSON> method is found, the value of C<allow_blessed> will decide what
  to do.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with the C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  This setting does not yet influence C<decode> in any way.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<allow_blessed> setting will decide what
  to do when a blessed object is found.
  
  =head2 filter_json_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_object([$coderef])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument passed to the coderef
  is a reference to the newly-created hash. If the code references returns
  a single scalar (which need not be a reference), this value
  (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid aliasing) is inserted into the
  deserialised data structure. If it returns an empty list
  (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the original deserialised
  hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON::PP->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]'); # the given subroutine takes a hash reference.
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  =head2 filter_json_single_key_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object($key [=> $coderef])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON::PP
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  =head2 shrink
  
      $json = $json->shrink([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  In JSON::XS, this flag resizes strings generated by either
  C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible.
  It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form if possible.
  
  In JSON::PP, it is noop about resizing strings but tries
  C<utf8::downgrade> to the returned string by C<encode>.
  See to L<utf8>.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>
  
  =head2 max_depth
  
      $json = $json->max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])
      
      $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  When a large value (100 or more) was set and it de/encodes a deep nested object/text,
  it may raise a warning 'Deep recursion on subroutin' at the perl runtime phase.
  
  =head2 max_size
  
      $json = $json->max_size([$maximum_string_size])
      
      $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 encode
  
      $json_text = $json->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure (a simple scalar or a reference
  to a hash or array) to its JSON representation. Simple scalars will be
  converted into JSON string or number sequences, while references to arrays
  become JSON arrays and references to hashes become JSON objects. Undefined
  Perl values (e.g. C<undef>) become JSON C<null> values.
  References to the integers C<0> and C<1> are converted into C<true> and C<false>.
  
  =head2 decode
  
      $perl_scalar = $json->decode($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  JSON numbers and strings become simple Perl scalars. JSON arrays become
  Perl arrayrefs and JSON objects become Perl hashrefs. C<true> becomes
  C<1> (C<JSON::true>), C<false> becomes C<0> (C<JSON::false>) and
  C<null> becomes C<undef>.
  
  =head2 decode_prefix
  
      ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
     JSON->new->decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
     => ([], 3)
  
  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  Most of this section are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING>.
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON texts.
  This module does allow you to parse a JSON stream incrementally.
  It does so by accumulating text until it has a full JSON object, which
  it then can decode. This process is similar to using C<decode_prefix>
  to see if a full JSON object is available, but is much more efficient
  (and can be implemented with a minimum of method calls).
  
  This module will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect parenthese
  mismatches. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =head2 incr_parse
  
      $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
      
      $obj_or_undef = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
      
      @obj_or_empty = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the errornous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
  an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
  case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
  lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return them.
  
      my @objs = JSON->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =head2 incr_text
  
      $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
      $json->incr_text =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
  
  In Perl 5.005, C<lvalue> attribute is not available.
  You must write codes like the below:
  
      $string = $json->incr_text;
      $string =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
      $json->incr_text( $string );
  
  =head2 incr_skip
  
      $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove the
  parsed text from the input buffer. This is useful after C<incr_parse>
  died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser state is left
  unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the parse state.
  
  =head2 incr_reset
  
      $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want ot repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING> for examples.
  
  
  =head1 JSON::PP OWN METHODS
  
  =head2 allow_singlequote
  
      $json = $json->allow_singlequote([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  JSON strings quoted by single quotations that are invalid JSON
  format.
  
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({"foo":'bar'});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':"bar"});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':'bar'});
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
  
  =head2 allow_barekey
  
      $json = $json->allow_barekey([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  bare keys of JSON object that are invalid JSON format.
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
      $json->allow_barekey->decode('{foo:"bar"}');
  
  =head2 allow_bignum
  
      $json = $json->allow_bignum([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will convert
  the big integer Perl cannot handle as integer into a L<Math::BigInt>
  object and convert a floating number (any) into a L<Math::BigFloat>.
  
  On the contary, C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers with C<allow_blessed> enable.
  
     $json->allow_nonref->allow_blessed->allow_bignum;
     $bigfloat = $json->decode('2.000000000000000000000000001');
     print $json->encode($bigfloat);
     # => 2.000000000000000000000000001
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING> aboout the normal conversion of JSON number.
  
  =head2 loose
  
      $json = $json->loose([$enable])
  
  The unescaped [\x00-\x1f\x22\x2f\x5c] strings are invalid in JSON strings
  and the module doesn't allow to C<decode> to these (except for \x2f).
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode>  will accept these
  unescaped strings.
  
      $json->loose->decode(qq|["abc
                                     def"]|);
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS>.
  
  =head2 escape_slash
  
      $json = $json->escape_slash([$enable])
  
  According to JSON Grammar, I<slash> (U+002F) is escaped. But default
  JSON::PP (as same as JSON::XS) encodes strings without escaping slash.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will escape slashes.
  
  =head2 indent_length
  
      $json = $json->indent_length($length)
  
  JSON::XS indent space length is 3 and cannot be changed.
  JSON::PP set the indent space length with the given $length.
  The default is 3. The acceptable range is 0 to 15.
  
  =head2 sort_by
  
      $json = $json->sort_by($function_name)
      $json = $json->sort_by($subroutine_ref)
  
  If $function_name or $subroutine_ref are set, its sort routine are used
  in encoding JSON objects.
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by(sub { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b })->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by('own_sort')->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     sub JSON::PP::own_sort { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b }
  
  As the sorting routine runs in the JSON::PP scope, the given
  subroutine name and the special variables C<$a>, C<$b> will begin
  'JSON::PP::'.
  
  If $integer is set, then the effect is same as C<canonical> on.

  =head1 MAPPING
  
  This section is copied from JSON::XS and modified to C<JSON::PP>.
  JSON::XS and JSON::PP mapping mechanisms are almost equivalent.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING>.
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserver object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, C<JSON> will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded toa JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, C<JSON> only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the leats significant bit.
  
  When C<allow_bignum> is enable, the big integers 
  and the numeric can be optionally converted into L<Math::BigInt> and
  L<Math::BigFloat> objects.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<JSON::PP::true> and C<JSON::PP::false>,
  respectively. They are overloaded to act almost exactly like the numbers
  C<1> and C<0>. You can check wether a scalar is a JSON boolean by using
  the C<JSON::is_bool> function.
  
     print JSON::PP::true . "\n";
      => true
     print JSON::PP::true + 1;
      => 1
  
     ok(JSON::true eq  '1');
     ok(JSON::true == 1);
  
  C<JSON> will install these missing overloading features to the backend modules.
  
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  C<JSON::PP::null> returns C<unddef>.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent ordering
  in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded in a
  pseudo-random order that can change between runs of the same program but
  stays generally the same within a single run of a program. C<JSON>
  optionally sort the hash keys (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so
  the same datastructure will serialise to the same JSON text (given same
  settings and version of JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead
  and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text
  against another for equality.
  
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON. You can
  also use C<JSON::false> and C<JSON::true> to improve readability.
  
     to_json [\0,JSON::PP::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item JSON::PP::true, JSON::PP::false, JSON::PP::null
  
  These special values become JSON true and JSON false values,
  respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0> directly if you want.
  
  JSON::PP::null returns C<undef>.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON. See the
  C<allow_blessed> and C<convert_blessed> methods on various options on
  how to deal with this: basically, you can choose between throwing an
  exception, encoding the reference as if it weren't blessed, or provide
  your own serialiser method.
  
  See to L<convert_blessed>.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS and JSON::PP will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
  
  You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choise is yours.
  
  You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways.
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  =item Big Number
  
  When C<allow_bignum> is enable, 
  C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers.
  
  
  =back
  
  =head1 UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS
  
  If you do not know about Unicode on Perl well,
  please check L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>.
  
  =head2 Perl 5.8 and later
  
  Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work properly.
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345);
  
  Reuturns C<"\u3042"> and C<"\ud808\udf45"> respectively.
  
      $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\u3042"');
      $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
  
  Returns UTF-8 encoded strings with UTF8 flag, regarded as C<U+3042> and C<U+12345>.
  
  Note that the versions from Perl 5.8.0 to 5.8.2, Perl built-in C<join> was broken,
  so JSON::PP wraps the C<join> with a subroutine. Thus JSON::PP works slow in the versions.
  
  
  =head2 Perl 5.6
  
  Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work.
  
  =head2 Perl 5.005
  
  Perl 5.005 is a byte sementics world -- all strings are sequences of bytes.
  That means the unicode handling is not available.
  
  In encoding,
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);  # hex 3042 is 12354.
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345); # hex 12345 is 74565.
  
  Returns C<B> and C<E>, as C<chr> takes a value more than 255, it treats
  as C<$value % 256>, so the above codes are equivalent to :
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 66);
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 69);
  
  In decoding,
  
      $json->decode('"\u00e3\u0081\u0082"');
  
  The returned is a byte sequence C<0xE3 0x81 0x82> for UTF-8 encoded
  japanese character (C<HIRAGANA LETTER A>).
  And if it is represented in Unicode code point, C<U+3042>.
  
  Next, 
  
      $json->decode('"\u3042"');
  
  We ordinary expect the returned value is a Unicode character C<U+3042>.
  But here is 5.005 world. This is C<0xE3 0x81 0x82>.
  
      $json->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
  
  This is not a character C<U+12345> but bytes - C<0xf0 0x92 0x8d 0x85>.

  =head1 VERSION
  
      2.27200
  
  L<JSON::XS> 2.27 (~2.30) compatible.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module is L<JSON::XS> compatible pure Perl module.
  (Perl 5.8 or later is recommended)
  
  JSON::XS is the fastest and most proper JSON module on CPAN.
  It is written by Marc Lehmann in C, so must be compiled and
  installed in the used environment.
  
  JSON::PP is a pure-Perl module and has compatibility to JSON::XS.
  
  
  =head2 FEATURES
  
  =over
  
  =item * correct unicode handling
  
  This module knows how to handle Unicode (depending on Perl version).
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL> and
  L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  
  =item * round-trip integrity
  
  When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types
  supported by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is
  identical on the Perl level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly
  become "2" just because it looks like a number). There I<are> minor
  exceptions to this, read the MAPPING section below to learn about
  those.
  
  
  =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
  
  There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
  and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a
  security feature). But when some options are set, loose checking
  features are available.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  Some documents are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE>.
  
  =head2 encode_json
  
      $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $json_text = JSON::PP->new->utf8->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  =head2 decode_json
  
      $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
      $perl_scalar = JSON::PP->new->utf8->decode($json_text)
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::is_bool
  
      $is_boolean = JSON::PP::is_bool($scalar)
  
  Returns true if the passed scalar represents either JSON::PP::true or
  JSON::PP::false, two constants that act like C<1> and C<0> respectively
  and are also used to represent JSON C<true> and C<false> in Perl strings.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::true
  
  Returns JSON true value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::false
  
  Returns JSON false value which is blessed object.
  It C<isa> JSON::PP::Boolean object.
  
  =head2 JSON::PP::null
  
  Returns C<undef>.
  
  See L<MAPPING>, below, for more information on how JSON values are mapped to
  Perl.
  
  
  =head1 HOW DO I DECODE A DATA FROM OUTER AND ENCODE TO OUTER
  
  This section supposes that your perl version is 5.8 or later.
  
  If you know a JSON text from an outer world - a network, a file content, and so on,
  is encoded in UTF-8, you should use C<decode_json> or C<JSON> module object
  with C<utf8> enable. And the decoded result will contain UNICODE characters.
  
    # from network
    my $json        = JSON::PP->new->utf8;
    my $json_text   = CGI->new->param( 'json_data' );
    my $perl_scalar = $json->decode( $json_text );
    
    # from file content
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    $json_text   = <$fh>;
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( $json_text );
  
  If an outer data is not encoded in UTF-8, firstly you should C<decode> it.
  
    use Encode;
    local $/;
    open( my $fh, '<', 'json.data' );
    my $encoding = 'cp932';
    my $unicode_json_text = decode( $encoding, <$fh> ); # UNICODE
    
    # or you can write the below code.
    #
    # open( my $fh, "<:encoding($encoding)", 'json.data' );
    # $unicode_json_text = <$fh>;
  
  In this case, C<$unicode_json_text> is of course UNICODE string.
  So you B<cannot> use C<decode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
  
    $perl_scalar = $json->utf8(0)->decode( $unicode_json_text );
  
  Or C<encode 'utf8'> and C<decode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar = decode_json( encode( 'utf8', $unicode_json_text ) );
    # this way is not efficient.
  
  And now, you want to convert your C<$perl_scalar> into JSON data and
  send it to an outer world - a network or a file content, and so on.
  
  Your data usually contains UNICODE strings and you want the converted data to be encoded
  in UTF-8, you should use C<encode_json> or C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  
    print encode_json( $perl_scalar ); # to a network? file? or display?
    # or
    print $json->utf8->encode( $perl_scalar );
  
  If C<$perl_scalar> does not contain UNICODE but C<$encoding>-encoded strings
  for some reason, then its characters are regarded as B<latin1> for perl
  (because it does not concern with your $encoding).
  You B<cannot> use C<encode_json> nor C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> enable.
  Instead of them, you use C<JSON> module object with C<utf8> disable.
  Note that the resulted text is a UNICODE string but no problem to print it.
  
    # $perl_scalar contains $encoding encoded string values
    $unicode_json_text = $json->utf8(0)->encode( $perl_scalar );
    # $unicode_json_text consists of characters less than 0x100
    print $unicode_json_text;
  
  Or C<decode $encoding> all string values and C<encode_json>:
  
    $perl_scalar->{ foo } = decode( $encoding, $perl_scalar->{ foo } );
    # ... do it to each string values, then encode_json
    $json_text = encode_json( $perl_scalar );
  
  This method is a proper way but probably not efficient.
  
  See to L<Encode>, L<perluniintro>.
  
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  Basically, check to L<JSON> or L<JSON::XS>.
  
  =head2 new
  
      $json = JSON::PP->new
  
  Returns a new JSON::PP object that can be used to de/encode JSON
  strings.
  
  All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON::PP->new->utf8->space_after->encode({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =head2 ascii
  
      $json = $json->ascii([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will not generate characters outside
  the code range 0..127. Any Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either
  a single \uXXXX or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence, as per RFC4627.
  (See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>).
  
  In Perl 5.005, there is no character having high value (more than 255).
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters unless
  required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results in a faster and more compact format.
  
    JSON::PP->new->ascii(1)->encode([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =head2 latin1
  
      $json = $json->latin1([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the resulting JSON
  text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters outside the code range 0..255.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will not escape Unicode characters
  unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
    JSON::XS->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.
  
  =head2 utf8
  
      $json = $json->utf8([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then the encode method will encode the JSON result
  into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the decode method expects to be handled
  an UTF-8-encoded string. Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any
  characters outside the range 0..255, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O.
  
  (In Perl 5.005, any character outside the range 0..255 does not exist.
  See to L<UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS>.)
  
  In future versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16 and UTF-32
  encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If $enable is false, then the encode method will return the JSON string as a (non-encoded)
  Unicode string, while decode expects thus a Unicode string. Any decoding or encoding
  (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::PP->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::PP->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  
  =head2 pretty
  
      $json = $json->pretty([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> flags in one call to generate the most readable
  (or most compact) form possible.
  
  Equivalent to:
  
     $json->indent->space_before->space_after
  
  =head2 indent
  
      $json = $json->indent([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  The default indent space length is three.
  You can use C<indent_length> to change the length.
  
  =head2 space_before
  
      $json = $json->space_before([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  =head2 space_after
  
      $json = $json->space_after([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  =head2 relaxed
  
      $json = $json->relaxed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:

  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...
    ]
  
  =back
  
  =head2 canonical
  
      $json = $json->canonical([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  If you want your own sorting routine, you can give a code reference
  or a subroutine name to C<sort_by>. See to C<JSON::PP OWN METHODS>.
  
  =head2 allow_nonref
  
      $json = $json->allow_nonref([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
     JSON::PP->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =head2 allow_unknown
  
      $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If $enable is true (or missing), then "encode" will *not* throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON "null" value.
  Note that blessed objects are not included here and are handled
  separately by c<allow_nonref>.
  
  If $enable is false (the default), then "encode" will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect "decode" in any way, and it is
  recommended to leave it off unless you know your communications
  partner.
  
  =head2 allow_blessed
  
      $json = $json->allow_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference. Instead, the value of the
  B<convert_blessed> option will decide whether C<null> (C<convert_blessed>
  disabled or no C<TO_JSON> method found) or a representation of the
  object (C<convert_blessed> enabled and C<TO_JSON> method found) is being
  encoded. Has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object.
  
  =head2 convert_blessed
  
      $json = $json->convert_blessed([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context
  and the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object. If no
  C<TO_JSON> method is found, the value of C<allow_blessed> will decide what
  to do.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with the C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  This setting does not yet influence C<decode> in any way.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<allow_blessed> setting will decide what
  to do when a blessed object is found.
  
  =head2 filter_json_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_object([$coderef])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument passed to the coderef
  is a reference to the newly-created hash. If the code references returns
  a single scalar (which need not be a reference), this value
  (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid aliasing) is inserted into the
  deserialised data structure. If it returns an empty list
  (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the original deserialised
  hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON::PP->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]'); # the given subroutine takes a hash reference.
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  =head2 filter_json_single_key_object
  
      $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object($key [=> $coderef])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON::PP
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  =head2 shrink
  
      $json = $json->shrink([$enable])
      
      $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  In JSON::XS, this flag resizes strings generated by either
  C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible.
  It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form if possible.
  
  In JSON::PP, it is noop about resizing strings but tries
  C<utf8::downgrade> to the returned string by C<encode>.
  See to L<utf8>.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE>
  
  =head2 max_depth
  
      $json = $json->max_depth([$maximum_nesting_depth])
      
      $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  When a large value (100 or more) was set and it de/encodes a deep nested object/text,
  it may raise a warning 'Deep recursion on subroutine' at the perl runtime phase.
  
  =head2 max_size
  
      $json = $json->max_size([$maximum_string_size])
      
      $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS> for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =head2 encode
  
      $json_text = $json->encode($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure (a simple scalar or a reference
  to a hash or array) to its JSON representation. Simple scalars will be
  converted into JSON string or number sequences, while references to arrays
  become JSON arrays and references to hashes become JSON objects. Undefined
  Perl values (e.g. C<undef>) become JSON C<null> values.
  References to the integers C<0> and C<1> are converted into C<true> and C<false>.
  
  =head2 decode
  
      $perl_scalar = $json->decode($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  JSON numbers and strings become simple Perl scalars. JSON arrays become
  Perl arrayrefs and JSON objects become Perl hashrefs. C<true> becomes
  C<1> (C<JSON::true>), C<false> becomes C<0> (C<JSON::false>) and
  C<null> becomes C<undef>.
  
  =head2 decode_prefix
  
      ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
     JSON->new->decode_prefix ("[1] the tail")
     => ([], 3)
  
  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  Most of this section are copied and modified from L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING>.
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON texts.
  This module does allow you to parse a JSON stream incrementally.
  It does so by accumulating text until it has a full JSON object, which
  it then can decode. This process is similar to using C<decode_prefix>
  to see if a full JSON object is available, but is much more efficient
  (and can be implemented with a minimum of method calls).
  
  This module will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect parenthesis
  mismatches. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =head2 incr_parse
  
      $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
      
      $obj_or_undef = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
      
      @obj_or_empty = $json->incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the erroneous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
  an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
  case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
  lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return them.
  
      my @objs = JSON->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =head2 incr_text
  
      $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
      $json->incr_text =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
  
  In Perl 5.005, C<lvalue> attribute is not available.
  You must write codes like the below:
  
      $string = $json->incr_text;
      $string =~ s/\s*,\s*//;
      $json->incr_text( $string );
  
  =head2 incr_skip
  
      $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove the
  parsed text from the input buffer. This is useful after C<incr_parse>
  died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser state is left
  unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the parse state.
  
  =head2 incr_reset
  
      $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/INCREMENTAL PARSING> for examples.
  
  
  =head1 JSON::PP OWN METHODS
  
  =head2 allow_singlequote
  
      $json = $json->allow_singlequote([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  JSON strings quoted by single quotations that are invalid JSON
  format.
  
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({"foo":'bar'});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':"bar"});
      $json->allow_singlequote->decode({'foo':'bar'});
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
  
  =head2 allow_barekey
  
      $json = $json->allow_barekey([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept
  bare keys of JSON object that are invalid JSON format.
  
  As same as the C<relaxed> option, this option may be used to parse
  application-specific files written by humans.
  
      $json->allow_barekey->decode('{foo:"bar"}');
  
  =head2 allow_bignum
  
      $json = $json->allow_bignum([$enable])
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will convert
  the big integer Perl cannot handle as integer into a L<Math::BigInt>
  object and convert a floating number (any) into a L<Math::BigFloat>.
  
  On the contrary, C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers with C<allow_blessed> enable.
  
     $json->allow_nonref->allow_blessed->allow_bignum;
     $bigfloat = $json->decode('2.000000000000000000000000001');
     print $json->encode($bigfloat);
     # => 2.000000000000000000000000001
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING> about the normal conversion of JSON number.
  
  =head2 loose
  
      $json = $json->loose([$enable])
  
  The unescaped [\x00-\x1f\x22\x2f\x5c] strings are invalid in JSON strings
  and the module doesn't allow to C<decode> to these (except for \x2f).
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode>  will accept these
  unescaped strings.
  
      $json->loose->decode(qq|["abc
                                     def"]|);
  
  See L<JSON::XS/SSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS>.
  
  =head2 escape_slash
  
      $json = $json->escape_slash([$enable])
  
  According to JSON Grammar, I<slash> (U+002F) is escaped. But default
  JSON::PP (as same as JSON::XS) encodes strings without escaping slash.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will escape slashes.
  
  =head2 indent_length
  
      $json = $json->indent_length($length)
  
  JSON::XS indent space length is 3 and cannot be changed.
  JSON::PP set the indent space length with the given $length.
  The default is 3. The acceptable range is 0 to 15.
  
  =head2 sort_by
  
      $json = $json->sort_by($function_name)
      $json = $json->sort_by($subroutine_ref)
  
  If $function_name or $subroutine_ref are set, its sort routine are used
  in encoding JSON objects.
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by(sub { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b })->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     $js = $pc->sort_by('own_sort')->encode($obj);
     # is($js, q|{"a":1,"b":2,"c":3,"d":4,"e":5,"f":6,"g":7,"h":8,"i":9}|);
  
     sub JSON::PP::own_sort { $JSON::PP::a cmp $JSON::PP::b }
  
  As the sorting routine runs in the JSON::PP scope, the given
  subroutine name and the special variables C<$a>, C<$b> will begin
  'JSON::PP::'.
  
  If $integer is set, then the effect is same as C<canonical> on.

  =head1 MAPPING
  
  This section is copied from JSON::XS and modified to C<JSON::PP>.
  JSON::XS and JSON::PP mapping mechanisms are almost equivalent.
  
  See to L<JSON::XS/MAPPING>.
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserver object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, C<JSON> will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded to a JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, C<JSON> only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the least significant bit.
  
  When C<allow_bignum> is enable, the big integers 
  and the numeric can be optionally converted into L<Math::BigInt> and
  L<Math::BigFloat> objects.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<JSON::PP::true> and C<JSON::PP::false>,
  respectively. They are overloaded to act almost exactly like the numbers
  C<1> and C<0>. You can check whether a scalar is a JSON boolean by using
  the C<JSON::is_bool> function.
  
     print JSON::PP::true . "\n";
      => true
     print JSON::PP::true + 1;
      => 1
  
     ok(JSON::true eq  '1');
     ok(JSON::true == 1);
  
  C<JSON> will install these missing overloading features to the backend modules.
  
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  C<JSON::PP::null> returns C<undef>.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent ordering
  in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded in a
  pseudo-random order that can change between runs of the same program but
  stays generally the same within a single run of a program. C<JSON>
  optionally sort the hash keys (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so
  the same data structure will serialise to the same JSON text (given same
  settings and version of JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead
  and is only rarely useful, e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text
  against another for equality.
  
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON. You can
  also use C<JSON::false> and C<JSON::true> to improve readability.
  
     to_json [\0,JSON::PP::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item JSON::PP::true, JSON::PP::false, JSON::PP::null
  
  These special values become JSON true and JSON false values,
  respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0> directly if you want.
  
  JSON::PP::null returns C<undef>.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON. See the
  C<allow_blessed> and C<convert_blessed> methods on various options on
  how to deal with this: basically, you can choose between throwing an
  exception, encoding the reference as if it weren't blessed, or provide
  your own serialiser method.
  
  See to L<convert_blessed>.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS and JSON::PP will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
  
  You can force the type to be a number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
  
  You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways.
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  =item Big Number
  
  When C<allow_bignum> is enable, 
  C<encode> converts C<Math::BigInt> objects and C<Math::BigFloat>
  objects into JSON numbers.

  =head1 UNICODE HANDLING ON PERLS
  
  If you do not know about Unicode on Perl well,
  please check L<JSON::XS/A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL>.
  
  =head2 Perl 5.8 and later
  
  Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work properly.
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345);
  
  Returns C<"\u3042"> and C<"\ud808\udf45"> respectively.
  
      $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\u3042"');
      $json->allow_nonref->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
  
  Returns UTF-8 encoded strings with UTF8 flag, regarded as C<U+3042> and C<U+12345>.
  
  Note that the versions from Perl 5.8.0 to 5.8.2, Perl built-in C<join> was broken,
  so JSON::PP wraps the C<join> with a subroutine. Thus JSON::PP works slow in the versions.
  
  
  =head2 Perl 5.6
  
  Perl can handle Unicode and the JSON::PP de/encode methods also work.
  
  =head2 Perl 5.005
  
  Perl 5.005 is a byte semantics world -- all strings are sequences of bytes.
  That means the unicode handling is not available.
  
  In encoding,
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 3042);  # hex 3042 is 12354.
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr hex 12345); # hex 12345 is 74565.
  
  Returns C<B> and C<E>, as C<chr> takes a value more than 255, it treats
  as C<$value % 256>, so the above codes are equivalent to :
  
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 66);
      $json->allow_nonref->encode(chr 69);
  
  In decoding,
  
      $json->decode('"\u00e3\u0081\u0082"');
  
  The returned is a byte sequence C<0xE3 0x81 0x82> for UTF-8 encoded
  japanese character (C<HIRAGANA LETTER A>).
  And if it is represented in Unicode code point, C<U+3042>.
  
  Next, 
  
      $json->decode('"\u3042"');
  
  We ordinary expect the returned value is a Unicode character C<U+3042>.
  But here is 5.005 world. This is C<0xE3 0x81 0x82>.
  
      $json->decode('"\ud808\udf45"');
  
  This is not a character C<U+12345> but bytes - C<0xf0 0x92 0x8d 0x85>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Module::CPANfile - Parse cpanfile
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use Module::CPANfile;
  
    my $file = Module::CPANfile->load("cpanfile");
    my $prereqs = $file->prereqs; # CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object
  
    my @features = $file->features; # CPAN::Meta::Feature objects
    my $merged_prereqs = $file->prereqs_with(@identifiers); # CPAN::Meta::Prereqs
  
    $file->merge_meta('MYMETA.json');
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Module::CPANfile is a tool to handle L<cpanfile> format to load application
  specific dependencies, not just for CPAN distributions.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item load
  
    $file = Module::CPANfile->load;
    $file = Module::CPANfile->load('cpanfile');
  
  Load and parse a cpanfile. By default it tries to load C<cpanfile> in
  the current directory, unless you pass the path to its argument.
  
  =item from_prereqs
  
    $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs({
      runtime => { requires => { DBI => '1.000' } },
    });
  
  Creates a new Module::CPANfile object from prereqs hash you can get
  via L<CPAN::Meta>'s C<prereqs>, or L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs>'
  C<as_string_hash>.
  
    # read MYMETA, then feed the prereqs to create Module::CPANfile
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file('MYMETA.json');
    my $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($meta->prereqs);
  
    # load cpanfile, then recreate it with round-trip
    my $file = Module::CPANfile->load('cpanfile');
    $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($file->prereq_specs);
                                      # or $file->prereqs->as_string_hash
  
  =item prereqs
  
  Returns L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object out of the parsed cpanfile.
  
  =item prereq_specs
  
  Returns a hash reference that should be passed to C<< CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new >>.
  
  =item features
  
  Returns a list of features available in the cpanfile as L<CPAN::Meta::Feature>.
  
  =item prereqs_with(@identifiers), effective_prereqs(\@identifiers)
  
  Returns L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> object, with merged prereqs for
  features identified with the C<@identifiers>.
  
  =item to_string($include_empty)
  
    $file->to_string;
    $file->to_string(1);
  
  Returns a canonical string (code) representation for cpanfile. Useful
  if you want to convert L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs> to a new cpanfile.
  
    # read MYMETA's prereqs and print cpanfile representation of it
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file('MYMETA.json');
    my $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($meta->prereqs);
    print $file->to_string;
  
  By default, it omits the phase where there're no modules
  registered. If you pass the argument of a true value, it will print
  them as well.
  
  =item save
  
    $file->save('cpanfile');
  
  Saves the currently loaded prereqs as a new C<cpanfile> by calling
  C<to_string>. Beware B<this method will overwrite the existing
  cpanfile without any warning or backup>. Taking a backup or giving
  warnings to users is a caller's responsibility.
  
    # Read MYMETA.json and creates a new cpanfile
    my $meta = CPAN::Meta->load_file('MYMETA.json');
    my $file = Module::CPANfile->from_prereqs($meta->prereqs);
    $file->save('cpanfile');
  
  =item merge_meta
  
    $file->merge_meta('META.yml');
    $file->merge_meta('MYMETA.json', '2.0');
  
  Merge the effective prereqs with Meta specification loaded from the
  given META file, using CPAN::Meta. You can specify the META spec
  version in the second argument, which defaults to 1.4 in case the
  given file is YAML, and 2 if it is JSON.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Module::Metadata - Gather package and POD information from perl module files
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use Module::Metadata;
  
    # information about a .pm file
    my $info = Module::Metadata->new_from_file( $file );
    my $version = $info->version;
  
    # CPAN META 'provides' field for .pm files in a directory
    my $provides = Module::Metadata->provides(
      dir => 'lib', version => 2
    );
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides a standard way to gather metadata about a .pm file through
  (mostly) static analysis and (some) code execution.  When determining the
  version of a module, the C<$VERSION> assignment is C<eval>ed, as is traditional
  in the CPAN toolchain.
  
  =head1 CLASS METHODS
  
  =head2 C<< new_from_file($filename, collect_pod => 1) >>
  
  Constructs a C<Module::Metadata> object given the path to a file.  Returns
  undef if the filename does not exist.
  
  C<collect_pod> is a optional boolean argument that determines whether POD
  data is collected and stored for reference.  POD data is not collected by
  default.  POD headings are always collected.
  
  If the file begins by an UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE byte-order mark, then
  it is skipped before processing, and the content of the file is also decoded
  appropriately starting from perl 5.8.
  
  =head2 C<< new_from_handle($handle, $filename, collect_pod => 1) >>
  
  This works just like C<new_from_file>, except that a handle can be provided
  as the first argument.
  
  Note that there is no validation to confirm that the handle is a handle or
  something that can act like one.  Passing something that isn't a handle will
  cause a exception when trying to read from it.  The C<filename> argument is
  mandatory or undef will be returned.
  
  You are responsible for setting the decoding layers on C<$handle> if
  required.
  
  =head2 C<< new_from_module($module, collect_pod => 1, inc => \@dirs) >>
  
  Constructs a C<Module::Metadata> object given a module or package name.
  Returns undef if the module cannot be found.
  
  In addition to accepting the C<collect_pod> argument as described above,
  this method accepts a C<inc> argument which is a reference to an array of
  directories to search for the module.  If none are given, the default is
  @INC.
  
  If the file that contains the module begins by an UTF-8, UTF-16BE or
  UTF-16LE byte-order mark, then it is skipped before processing, and the
  content of the file is also decoded appropriately starting from perl 5.8.
  
  =head2 C<< find_module_by_name($module, \@dirs) >>
  
  Returns the path to a module given the module or package name. A list
  of directories can be passed in as an optional parameter, otherwise
  @INC is searched.
  
  Can be called as either an object or a class method.
  
  =head2 C<< find_module_dir_by_name($module, \@dirs) >>
  
  Returns the entry in C<@dirs> (or C<@INC> by default) that contains
  the module C<$module>. A list of directories can be passed in as an
  optional parameter, otherwise @INC is searched.
  
  Can be called as either an object or a class method.
  
  =head2 C<< provides( %options ) >>
  
  This is a convenience wrapper around C<package_versions_from_directory>
  to generate a CPAN META C<provides> data structure.  It takes key/value
  pairs.  Valid option keys include:
  
  =over
  
  =item version B<(required)>
  
  Specifies which version of the L<CPAN::Meta::Spec> should be used as
  the format of the C<provides> output.  Currently only '1.4' and '2'
  are supported (and their format is identical).  This may change in
  the future as the definition of C<provides> changes.
  
  The C<version> option is required.  If it is omitted or if
  an unsupported version is given, then C<provides> will throw an error.
  
  =item dir
  
  Directory to search recursively for F<.pm> files.  May not be specified with
  C<files>.
  
  =item files
  
  Array reference of files to examine.  May not be specified with C<dir>.
  
  =item prefix
  
  String to prepend to the C<file> field of the resulting output. This defaults
  to F<lib>, which is the common case for most CPAN distributions with their
  F<.pm> files in F<lib>.  This option ensures the META information has the
  correct relative path even when the C<dir> or C<files> arguments are
  absolute or have relative paths from a location other than the distribution
  root.
  
  =back
  
  For example, given C<dir> of 'lib' and C<prefix> of 'lib', the return value
  is a hashref of the form:
  
    {
      'Package::Name' => {
        version => '0.123',
        file => 'lib/Package/Name.pm'
      },
      'OtherPackage::Name' => ...
    }
  
  =head2 C<< package_versions_from_directory($dir, \@files?) >>
  
  Scans C<$dir> for .pm files (unless C<@files> is given, in which case looks
  for those files in C<$dir> - and reads each file for packages and versions,
  returning a hashref of the form:
  
    {
      'Package::Name' => {
        version => '0.123',
        file => 'Package/Name.pm'
      },
      'OtherPackage::Name' => ...
    }
  
  The C<DB> and C<main> packages are always omitted, as are any "private"
  packages that have leading underscores in the namespace (e.g.
  C<Foo::_private>)
  
  Note that the file path is relative to C<$dir> if that is specified.
  This B<must not> be used directly for CPAN META C<provides>.  See
  the C<provides> method instead.
  
  =head2 C<< log_info (internal) >>
  
  Used internally to perform logging; imported from Log::Contextual if
  Log::Contextual has already been loaded, otherwise simply calls warn.
  
  =head1 OBJECT METHODS
  
  =head2 C<< name() >>
  
  Returns the name of the package represented by this module. If there
  is more than one package, it makes a best guess based on the
  filename. If it's a script (i.e. not a *.pm) the package name is
  'main'.
  
  =head2 C<< version($package) >>
  
  Returns the version as defined by the $VERSION variable for the
  package as returned by the C<name> method if no arguments are
  given. If given the name of a package it will attempt to return the
  version of that package if it is specified in the file.
  
  =head2 C<< filename() >>
  
  Returns the absolute path to the file.
  Note that this file may not actually exist on disk yet, e.g. if the module was read from an in-memory filehandle.
  
  =head2 C<< packages_inside() >>
  
  Returns a list of packages. Note: this is a raw list of packages
  discovered (or assumed, in the case of C<main>).  It is not
  filtered for C<DB>, C<main> or private packages the way the
  C<provides> method does.  Invalid package names are not returned,
  for example "Foo:Bar".  Strange but valid package names are
  returned, for example "Foo::Bar::", and are left up to the caller
  on how to handle.
  
  =head2 C<< pod_inside() >>
  
  Returns a list of POD sections.
  
  =head2 C<< contains_pod() >>
  
  Returns true if there is any POD in the file.
  
  =head2 C<< pod($section) >>
  
  Returns the POD data in the given section.
  
  =head2 C<< is_indexable($package) >> or C<< is_indexable() >>
  
  Returns a boolean indicating whether the package (if provided) or any package
  (otherwise) is eligible for indexing by PAUSE, the Perl Authors Upload Server.
  Note This only checks for valid C<package> declarations, and does not take any
  ownership information into account.

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  B<Parse::CPAN::Meta> is a parser for F<META.json> and F<META.yml> files, using
  L<JSON::PP> and/or L<CPAN::Meta::YAML>.
  
  B<Parse::CPAN::Meta> provides three methods: C<load_file>, C<load_json_string>,
  and C<load_yaml_string>.  These will read and deserialize CPAN metafiles, and
  are described below in detail.
  
  B<Parse::CPAN::Meta> provides a legacy API of only two functions,
  based on the YAML functions of the same name. Wherever possible,
  identical calling semantics are used.  These may only be used with YAML sources.
  
  All error reporting is done with exceptions (die'ing).
  
  Note that META files are expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, only.  When
  converted string data, it must first be decoded from UTF-8.

  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 load_file
  
    my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_file('META.json');
  
    my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_file('META.yml');
  
  This method will read the named file and deserialize it to a data structure,
  determining whether it should be JSON or YAML based on the filename.
  The file will be read using the ":utf8" IO layer.
  
  =head2 load_yaml_string
  
    my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_yaml_string($yaml_string);
  
  This method deserializes the given string of YAML and returns the first
  document in it.  (CPAN metadata files should always have only one document.)
  If the source was UTF-8 encoded, the string must be decoded before calling
  C<load_yaml_string>.
  
  =head2 load_json_string
  
    my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_json_string($json_string);
  
  This method deserializes the given string of JSON and the result.  
  If the source was UTF-8 encoded, the string must be decoded before calling
  C<load_json_string>.
  
  =head2 load_string
  
    my $metadata_structure = Parse::CPAN::Meta->load_string($some_string);
  
  If you don't know whether a string contains YAML or JSON data, this method
  will use some heuristics and guess.  If it can't tell, it assumes YAML.
  
  =head2 yaml_backend
  
    my $backend = Parse::CPAN::Meta->yaml_backend;
  
  Returns the module name of the YAML serializer. See L</ENVIRONMENT>
  for details.
  
  =head2 json_backend
  
    my $backend = Parse::CPAN::Meta->json_backend;
  
  Returns the module name of the JSON serializer.  This will either
  be L<JSON::PP> or L<JSON>.  Even if C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND> is set,
  this will return L<JSON> as further delegation is handled by
  the L<JSON> module.  See L</ENVIRONMENT> for details.
  
  =head1 FUNCTIONS
  
  For maintenance clarity, no functions are exported by default.  These functions
  are available for backwards compatibility only and are best avoided in favor of
  C<load_file>.
  
  =head2 Load
  
    my @yaml = Parse::CPAN::Meta::Load( $string );
  
  Parses a string containing a valid YAML stream into a list of Perl data
  structures.
  
  =head2 LoadFile
  
    my @yaml = Parse::CPAN::Meta::LoadFile( 'META.yml' );
  
  Reads the YAML stream from a file instead of a string.
  
  =head1 ENVIRONMENT
  
  =head2 PERL_JSON_BACKEND
  
  By default, L<JSON::PP> will be used for deserializing JSON data. If the
  C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND> environment variable exists, is true and is not
  "JSON::PP", then the L<JSON> module (version 2.5 or greater) will be loaded and
  used to interpret C<PERL_JSON_BACKEND>.  If L<JSON> is not installed or is too
  old, an exception will be thrown.
  
  =head2 PERL_YAML_BACKEND
  
  By default, L<CPAN::Meta::YAML> will be used for deserializing YAML data. If
  the C<PERL_YAML_BACKEND> environment variable is defined, then it is interpreted
  as a module to use for deserialization.  The given module must be installed,
  must load correctly and must implement the C<Load()> function or an exception
  will be thrown.

  #pod Constructs a C<Path::Tiny> object.  It doesn't matter if you give a file or
  #pod directory path.  It's still up to you to call directory-like methods only on
  #pod directories and file-like methods only on files.  This function is exported
  #pod automatically by default.
  #pod
  #pod The first argument must be defined and have non-zero length or an exception
  #pod will be thrown.  This prevents subtle, dangerous errors with code like
  #pod C<< path( maybe_undef() )->remove_tree >>.
  #pod
  #pod If the first component of the path is a tilde ('~') then the component will be
  #pod replaced with the output of C<glob('~')>.  If the first component of the path
  #pod is a tilde followed by a user name then the component will be replaced with
  #pod output of C<glob('~username')>.  Behaviour for non-existent users depends on
  #pod the output of C<glob> on the system.
  #pod
  #pod On Windows, if the path consists of a drive identifier without a path component
  #pod (C<C:> or C<D:>), it will be expanded to the absolute path of the current
  #pod directory on that volume using C<Cwd::getdcwd()>.
  #pod
  #pod If called with a single C<Path::Tiny> argument, the original is returned unless

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provide a small, fast utility for working with file paths.  It is
  friendlier to use than L<File::Spec> and provides easy access to functions from
  several other core file handling modules.  It aims to be smaller and faster
  than many alternatives on CPAN while helping people do many common things in
  consistent and less error-prone ways.
  
  Path::Tiny does not try to work for anything except Unix-like and Win32
  platforms.  Even then, it might break if you try something particularly obscure
  or tortuous.  (Quick!  What does this mean:
  C<< ///../../..//./././a//b/.././c/././ >>?  And how does it differ on Win32?)
  
  All paths are forced to have Unix-style forward slashes.  Stringifying
  the object gives you back the path (after some clean up).
  
  File input/output methods C<flock> handles before reading or writing,
  as appropriate (if supported by the platform).
  
  The C<*_utf8> methods (C<slurp_utf8>, C<lines_utf8>, etc.) operate in raw mode.
  On Windows, that means they will not have CRLF translation from the C<:crlf> IO
  layer.  Installing L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58 or later will speed up C<*_utf8>
  situations in many cases and is highly recommended.
  
  =head1 CONSTRUCTORS
  
  =head2 path
  
      $path = path("foo/bar");
      $path = path("/tmp", "file.txt"); # list
      $path = path(".");                # cwd
      $path = path("~user/file.txt");   # tilde processing
  
  Constructs a C<Path::Tiny> object.  It doesn't matter if you give a file or
  directory path.  It's still up to you to call directory-like methods only on
  directories and file-like methods only on files.  This function is exported
  automatically by default.
  
  The first argument must be defined and have non-zero length or an exception
  will be thrown.  This prevents subtle, dangerous errors with code like
  C<< path( maybe_undef() )->remove_tree >>.
  
  If the first component of the path is a tilde ('~') then the component will be
  replaced with the output of C<glob('~')>.  If the first component of the path
  is a tilde followed by a user name then the component will be replaced with
  output of C<glob('~username')>.  Behaviour for non-existent users depends on
  the output of C<glob> on the system.
  
  On Windows, if the path consists of a drive identifier without a path component
  (C<C:> or C<D:>), it will be expanded to the absolute path of the current
  directory on that volume using C<Cwd::getdcwd()>.
  
  If called with a single C<Path::Tiny> argument, the original is returned unless
  the original is holding a temporary file or directory reference in which case a
  stringified copy is made.
  
      $path = path("foo/bar");
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile;
  
      $p2 = path($path); # like $p2 = $path
      $t2 = path($temp); # like $t2 = path( "$temp" )
  
  This optimizes copies without proliferating references unexpectedly if a copy is
  made by code outside your control.
  
  Current API available since 0.017.
  
  =head2 new
  
      $path = Path::Tiny->new("foo/bar");
  
  This is just like C<path>, but with method call overhead.  (Why would you
  do that?)
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 cwd
  
      $path = Path::Tiny->cwd; # path( Cwd::getcwd )
      $path = cwd; # optional export
  
  Gives you the absolute path to the current directory as a C<Path::Tiny> object.
  This is slightly faster than C<< path(".")->absolute >>.
  
  C<cwd> may be exported on request and used as a function instead of as a
  method.
  
  Current API available since 0.018.
  
  =head2 rootdir
  
      $path = Path::Tiny->rootdir; # /
      $path = rootdir;             # optional export 
  
  Gives you C<< File::Spec->rootdir >> as a C<Path::Tiny> object if you're too
  picky for C<path("/")>.
  
  C<rootdir> may be exported on request and used as a function instead of as a
  method.
  
  Current API available since 0.018.
  
  =head2 tempfile, tempdir
  
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile( @options );
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempdir( @options );
      $temp = tempfile( @options ); # optional export
      $temp = tempdir( @options );  # optional export
  
  C<tempfile> passes the options to C<< File::Temp->new >> and returns a C<Path::Tiny>
  object with the file name.  The C<TMPDIR> option is enabled by default.
  
  The resulting C<File::Temp> object is cached. When the C<Path::Tiny> object is
  destroyed, the C<File::Temp> object will be as well.
  
  C<File::Temp> annoyingly requires you to specify a custom template in slightly
  different ways depending on which function or method you call, but
  C<Path::Tiny> lets you ignore that and can take either a leading template or a
  C<TEMPLATE> option and does the right thing.
  
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile( "customXXXXXXXX" );             # ok
      $temp = Path::Tiny->tempfile( TEMPLATE => "customXXXXXXXX" ); # ok
  
  The tempfile path object will be normalized to have an absolute path, even if
  created in a relative directory using C<DIR>.
  
  C<tempdir> is just like C<tempfile>, except it calls
  C<< File::Temp->newdir >> instead.
  
  Both C<tempfile> and C<tempdir> may be exported on request and used as
  functions instead of as methods.
  
  B<Note>: for tempfiles, the filehandles from File::Temp are closed and not
  reused.  This is not as secure as using File::Temp handles directly, but is
  less prone to deadlocks or access problems on some platforms.  Think of what
  C<Path::Tiny> gives you to be just a temporary file B<name> that gets cleaned
  up.

  =head1 METHODS
  
  =head2 absolute
  
      $abs = path("foo/bar")->absolute;
      $abs = path("foo/bar")->absolute("/tmp");
  
  Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object with an absolute path (or itself if already
  absolute).  Unless an argument is given, the current directory is used as the
  absolute base path.  The argument must be absolute or you won't get an absolute
  result.
  
  This will not resolve upward directories ("foo/../bar") unless C<canonpath>
  in L<File::Spec> would normally do so on your platform.  If you need them
  resolved, you must call the more expensive C<realpath> method instead.
  
  On Windows, an absolute path without a volume component will have it added
  based on the current drive.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 append, append_raw, append_utf8
  
      path("foo.txt")->append(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->append(\@data);
      path("foo.txt")->append({binmode => ":raw"}, @data);
      path("foo.txt")->append_raw(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->append_utf8(@data);
  
  Appends data to a file.  The file is locked with C<flock> prior to writing.  An
  optional hash reference may be used to pass options.  Valid options are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<binmode>: passed to C<binmode()> on the handle used for writing.
  
  =item *
  
  C<truncate>: truncates the file after locking and before appending
  
  =back
  
  The C<truncate> option is a way to replace the contents of a file
  B<in place>, unlike L</spew> which writes to a temporary file and then
  replaces the original (if it exists).
  
  C<append_raw> is like C<append> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix> for fast,
  unbuffered, raw write.
  
  C<append_utf8> is like C<append> with a C<binmode> of
  C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>.  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw
  append will be done instead on the data encoded with C<Unicode::UTF8>.
  
  Current API available since 0.060.
  
  =head2 assert
  
      $path = path("foo.txt")->assert( sub { $_->exists } );
  
  Returns the invocant after asserting that a code reference argument returns
  true.  When the assertion code reference runs, it will have the invocant
  object in the C<$_> variable.  If it returns false, an exception will be
  thrown.  The assertion code reference may also throw its own exception.
  
  If no assertion is provided, the invocant is returned without error.
  
  Current API available since 0.062.
  
  =head2 basename
  
      $name = path("foo/bar.txt")->basename;        # bar.txt
      $name = path("foo.txt")->basename('.txt');    # foo
      $name = path("foo.txt")->basename(qr/.txt/);  # foo
      $name = path("foo.txt")->basename(@suffixes);
  
  Returns the file portion or last directory portion of a path.
  
  Given a list of suffixes as strings or regular expressions, any that match at
  the end of the file portion or last directory portion will be removed before
  the result is returned.
  
  Current API available since 0.054.
  
  =head2 canonpath
  
      $canonical = path("foo/bar")->canonpath; # foo\bar on Windows
  
  Returns a string with the canonical format of the path name for
  the platform.  In particular, this means directory separators
  will be C<\> on Windows.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 child
  
      $file = path("/tmp")->child("foo.txt"); # "/tmp/foo.txt"
      $file = path("/tmp")->child(@parts);
  
  Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object relative to the original.  Works
  like C<catfile> or C<catdir> from File::Spec, but without caring about
  file or directories.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 children
  
      @paths = path("/tmp")->children;
      @paths = path("/tmp")->children( qr/\.txt$/ );
  
  Returns a list of C<Path::Tiny> objects for all files and directories
  within a directory.  Excludes "." and ".." automatically.
  
  If an optional C<qr//> argument is provided, it only returns objects for child
  names that match the given regular expression.  Only the base name is used
  for matching:
  
      @paths = path("/tmp")->children( qr/^foo/ );
      # matches children like the glob foo*
  
  Current API available since 0.028.
  
  =head2 chmod
  
      path("foo.txt")->chmod(0777);
      path("foo.txt")->chmod("0755");
      path("foo.txt")->chmod("go-w");
      path("foo.txt")->chmod("a=r,u+wx");
  
  Sets file or directory permissions.  The argument can be a numeric mode, a
  octal string beginning with a "0" or a limited subset of the symbolic mode use
  by F</bin/chmod>.
  
  The symbolic mode must be a comma-delimited list of mode clauses.  Clauses must
  match C<< qr/\A([augo]+)([=+-])([rwx]+)\z/ >>, which defines "who", "op" and
  "perms" parameters for each clause.  Unlike F</bin/chmod>, all three parameters
  are required for each clause, multiple ops are not allowed and permissions
  C<stugoX> are not supported.  (See L<File::chmod> for more complex needs.)
  
  Current API available since 0.053.
  
  =head2 copy
  
      path("/tmp/foo.txt")->copy("/tmp/bar.txt");
  
  Copies a file using L<File::Copy>'s C<copy> function. Upon
  success, returns the C<Path::Tiny> object for the newly copied
  file.
  
  Current API available since 0.070.
  
  =head2 digest
  
      $obj = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->digest;        # SHA-256
      $obj = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->digest("MD5"); # user-selected
      $obj = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->digest( { chunk_size => 1e6 }, "MD5" );
  
  Returns a hexadecimal digest for a file.  An optional hash reference of options may
  be given.  The only option is C<chunk_size>.  If C<chunk_size> is given, that many
  bytes will be read at a time.  If not provided, the entire file will be slurped
  into memory to compute the digest.
  
  Any subsequent arguments are passed to the constructor for L<Digest> to select
  an algorithm.  If no arguments are given, the default is SHA-256.
  
  Current API available since 0.056.
  
  =head2 dirname (deprecated)
  
      $name = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->dirname; # "/tmp/"
  
  Returns the directory portion you would get from calling
  C<< File::Spec->splitpath( $path->stringify ) >> or C<"."> for a path without a
  parent directory portion.  Because L<File::Spec> is inconsistent, the result
  might or might not have a trailing slash.  Because of this, this method is
  B<deprecated>.
  
  A better, more consistently approach is likely C<< $path->parent->stringify >>,
  which will not have a trailing slash except for a root directory.
  
  Deprecated in 0.056.
  
  =head2 exists, is_file, is_dir
  
      if ( path("/tmp")->exists ) { ... }     # -e
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_dir ) { ... }     # -d
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_file ) { ... }    # -e && ! -d
  
  Implements file test operations, this means the file or directory actually has
  to exist on the filesystem.  Until then, it's just a path.
  
  B<Note>: C<is_file> is not C<-f> because C<-f> is not the opposite of C<-d>.
  C<-f> means "plain file", excluding symlinks, devices, etc. that often can be
  read just like files.
  
  Use C<-f> instead if you really mean to check for a plain file.
  
  Current API available since 0.053.
  
  =head2 filehandle
  
      $fh = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->filehandle($mode, $binmode);
      $fh = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->filehandle({ locked => 1 }, $mode, $binmode);
      $fh = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->filehandle({ exclusive => 1  }, $mode, $binmode);
  
  Returns an open file handle.  The C<$mode> argument must be a Perl-style
  read/write mode string ("<" ,">", "<<", etc.).  If a C<$binmode>
  is given, it is set during the C<open> call.
  
  An optional hash reference may be used to pass options.
  
  The C<locked> option governs file locking; if true, handles opened for writing,
  appending or read-write are locked with C<LOCK_EX>; otherwise, they are
  locked with C<LOCK_SH>.  When using C<locked>, ">" or "+>" modes will delay
  truncation until after the lock is acquired.
  
  The C<exclusive> option causes the open() call to fail if the file already
  exists.  This corresponds to the O_EXCL flag to sysopen / open(2).
  C<exclusive> implies C<locked> and will set it for you if you forget it.
  
  See C<openr>, C<openw>, C<openrw>, and C<opena> for sugar.
  
  Current API available since 0.066.
  
  =head2 is_absolute, is_relative
  
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_absolute ) { ... }
      if ( path("/tmp")->is_relative ) { ... }
  
  Booleans for whether the path appears absolute or relative.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 is_rootdir
  
      while ( ! $path->is_rootdir ) {
          $path = $path->parent;
          ...
      }
  
  Boolean for whether the path is the root directory of the volume.  I.e. the
  C<dirname> is C<q[/]> and the C<basename> is C<q[]>.
  
  This works even on C<MSWin32> with drives and UNC volumes:
  
      path("C:/")->is_rootdir;             # true
      path("//server/share/")->is_rootdir; #true
  
  Current API available since 0.038.
  
  =head2 iterator
  
      $iter = path("/tmp")->iterator( \%options );
  
  Returns a code reference that walks a directory lazily.  Each invocation
  returns a C<Path::Tiny> object or undef when the iterator is exhausted.
  
      $iter = path("/tmp")->iterator;
      while ( $path = $iter->() ) {
          ...
      }
  
  The current and parent directory entries ("." and "..") will not
  be included.
  
  If the C<recurse> option is true, the iterator will walk the directory
  recursively, breadth-first.  If the C<follow_symlinks> option is also true,
  directory links will be followed recursively.  There is no protection against
  loops when following links. If a directory is not readable, it will not be
  followed.
  
  The default is the same as:
  
      $iter = path("/tmp")->iterator( {
          recurse         => 0,
          follow_symlinks => 0,
      } );
  
  For a more powerful, recursive iterator with built-in loop avoidance, see
  L<Path::Iterator::Rule>.
  
  See also L</visit>.

  =head2 lines, lines_raw, lines_utf8
  
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines;
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines(\%options);
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines_raw;
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines_utf8;
  
      @contents = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines( { chomp => 1, count => 4 } );
  
  Returns a list of lines from a file.  Optionally takes a hash-reference of
  options.  Valid options are C<binmode>, C<count> and C<chomp>.
  
  If C<binmode> is provided, it will be set on the handle prior to reading.
  
  If a positive C<count> is provided, that many lines will be returned from the
  start of the file.  If a negative C<count> is provided, the entire file will be
  read, but only C<abs(count)> will be kept and returned.  If C<abs(count)>
  exceeds the number of lines in the file, all lines will be returned.
  
  If C<chomp> is set, any end-of-line character sequences (C<CR>, C<CRLF>, or
  C<LF>) will be removed from the lines returned.
  
  Because the return is a list, C<lines> in scalar context will return the number
  of lines (and throw away the data).
  
      $number_of_lines = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->lines;
  
  C<lines_raw> is like C<lines> with a C<binmode> of C<:raw>.  We use C<:raw>
  instead of C<:unix> so PerlIO buffering can manage reading by line.
  
  C<lines_utf8> is like C<lines> with a C<binmode> of
  C<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)>.  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw
  UTF-8 slurp will be done and then the lines will be split.  This is
  actually faster than relying on C<:encoding(UTF-8)>, though a bit memory
  intensive.  If memory use is a concern, consider C<openr_utf8> and
  iterating directly on the handle.
  
  Current API available since 0.065.
  
  =head2 mkpath
  
      path("foo/bar/baz")->mkpath;
      path("foo/bar/baz")->mkpath( \%options );
  
  Like calling C<make_path> from L<File::Path>.  An optional hash reference
  is passed through to C<make_path>.  Errors will be trapped and an exception
  thrown.  Returns the list of directories created or an empty list if
  the directories already exist, just like C<make_path>.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 move
  
      path("foo.txt")->move("bar.txt");
  
  Just like C<rename>.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 openr, openw, openrw, opena
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr($binmode);  # read
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openr_utf8;
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw($binmode);  # write
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openw_utf8;
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena($binmode);  # append
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->opena_utf8;
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw($binmode); # read/write
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw_raw;
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw_utf8;
  
  Returns a file handle opened in the specified mode.  The C<openr> style methods
  take a single C<binmode> argument.  All of the C<open*> methods have
  C<open*_raw> and C<open*_utf8> equivalents that use C<:raw> and
  C<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)>, respectively.
  
  An optional hash reference may be used to pass options.  The only option is
  C<locked>.  If true, handles opened for writing, appending or read-write are
  locked with C<LOCK_EX>; otherwise, they are locked for C<LOCK_SH>.
  
      $fh = path("foo.txt")->openrw_utf8( { locked => 1 } );
  
  See L</filehandle> for more on locking.

  =head2 parent
  
      $parent = path("foo/bar/baz")->parent; # foo/bar
      $parent = path("foo/wibble.txt")->parent; # foo
  
      $parent = path("foo/bar/baz")->parent(2); # foo
  
  Returns a C<Path::Tiny> object corresponding to the parent directory of the
  original directory or file. An optional positive integer argument is the number
  of parent directories upwards to return.  C<parent> by itself is equivalent to
  C<parent(1)>.
  
  Current API available since 0.014.
  
  =head2 realpath
  
      $real = path("/baz/foo/../bar")->realpath;
      $real = path("foo/../bar")->realpath;
  
  Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object with all symbolic links and upward directory
  parts resolved using L<Cwd>'s C<realpath>.  Compared to C<absolute>, this is
  more expensive as it must actually consult the filesystem.
  
  If the parent path can't be resolved (e.g. if it includes directories that
  don't exist), an exception will be thrown:
  
      $real = path("doesnt_exist/foo")->realpath; # dies
  
  However, if the parent path exists and only the last component (e.g. filename)
  doesn't exist, the realpath will be the realpath of the parent plus the
  non-existent last component:
  
      $real = path("./aasdlfasdlf")->realpath; # works
  
  The underlying L<Cwd> module usually worked this way on Unix, but died on
  Windows (and some Unixes) if the full path didn't exist.  As of version 0.064,
  it's safe to use anywhere.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 relative
  
      $rel = path("/tmp/foo/bar")->relative("/tmp"); # foo/bar
  
  Returns a C<Path::Tiny> object with a relative path name.
  Given the trickiness of this, it's a thin wrapper around
  C<< File::Spec->abs2rel() >>.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 remove
  
      path("foo.txt")->remove;
  
  This is just like C<unlink>, except for its error handling: if the path does
  not exist, it returns false; if deleting the file fails, it throws an
  exception.
  
  Current API available since 0.012.
  
  =head2 remove_tree
  
      # directory
      path("foo/bar/baz")->remove_tree;
      path("foo/bar/baz")->remove_tree( \%options );
      path("foo/bar/baz")->remove_tree( { safe => 0 } ); # force remove
  
  Like calling C<remove_tree> from L<File::Path>, but defaults to C<safe> mode.
  An optional hash reference is passed through to C<remove_tree>.  Errors will be
  trapped and an exception thrown.  Returns the number of directories deleted,
  just like C<remove_tree>.
  
  If you want to remove a directory only if it is empty, use the built-in
  C<rmdir> function instead.
  
      rmdir path("foo/bar/baz/");
  
  Current API available since 0.013.
  
  =head2 sibling
  
      $foo = path("/tmp/foo.txt");
      $sib = $foo->sibling("bar.txt");        # /tmp/bar.txt
      $sib = $foo->sibling("baz", "bam.txt"); # /tmp/baz/bam.txt
  
  Returns a new C<Path::Tiny> object relative to the parent of the original.
  This is slightly more efficient than C<< $path->parent->child(...) >>.
  
  Current API available since 0.058.
  
  =head2 slurp, slurp_raw, slurp_utf8
  
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp;
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp( {binmode => ":raw"} );
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp_raw;
      $data = path("foo.txt")->slurp_utf8;
  
  Reads file contents into a scalar.  Takes an optional hash reference may be
  used to pass options.  The only option is C<binmode>, which is passed to
  C<binmode()> on the handle used for reading.
  
  C<slurp_raw> is like C<slurp> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix> for
  a fast, unbuffered, raw read.
  
  C<slurp_utf8> is like C<slurp> with a C<binmode> of
  C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>.  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw
  slurp will be done instead and the result decoded with C<Unicode::UTF8>.
  This is just as strict and is roughly an order of magnitude faster than
  using C<:encoding(UTF-8)>.
  
  B<Note>: C<slurp> and friends lock the filehandle before slurping.  If
  you plan to slurp from a file created with L<File::Temp>, be sure to
  close other handles or open without locking to avoid a deadlock:
  
      my $tempfile = File::Temp->new(EXLOCK => 0);
      my $guts = path($tempfile)->slurp;
  
  Current API available since 0.004.
  
  =head2 spew, spew_raw, spew_utf8
  
      path("foo.txt")->spew(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew(\@data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew({binmode => ":raw"}, @data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew_raw(@data);
      path("foo.txt")->spew_utf8(@data);
  
  Writes data to a file atomically.  The file is written to a temporary file in
  the same directory, then renamed over the original.  An optional hash reference
  may be used to pass options.  The only option is C<binmode>, which is passed to
  C<binmode()> on the handle used for writing.
  
  C<spew_raw> is like C<spew> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix> for a fast,
  unbuffered, raw write.
  
  C<spew_utf8> is like C<spew> with a C<binmode> of C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>.
  If L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58+ is installed, a raw spew will be done instead on
  the data encoded with C<Unicode::UTF8>.
  
  B<NOTE>: because the file is written to a temporary file and then renamed, the
  new file will wind up with permissions based on your current umask.  This is a
  feature to protect you from a race condition that would otherwise give
  different permissions than you might expect.  If you really want to keep the
  original mode flags, use L</append> with the C<truncate> option.

  =head2 stat, lstat
  
      $stat = path("foo.txt")->stat;
      $stat = path("/some/symlink")->lstat;
  
  Like calling C<stat> or C<lstat> from L<File::stat>.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 stringify
  
      $path = path("foo.txt");
      say $path->stringify; # same as "$path"
  
  Returns a string representation of the path.  Unlike C<canonpath>, this method
  returns the path standardized with Unix-style C</> directory separators.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.
  
  =head2 subsumes
  
      path("foo/bar")->subsumes("foo/bar/baz"); # true
      path("/foo/bar")->subsumes("/foo/baz");   # false
  
  Returns true if the first path is a prefix of the second path at a directory
  boundary.
  
  This B<does not> resolve parent directory entries (C<..>) or symlinks:
  
      path("foo/bar")->subsumes("foo/bar/../baz"); # true
  
  If such things are important to you, ensure that both paths are resolved to
  the filesystem with C<realpath>:
  
      my $p1 = path("foo/bar")->realpath;
      my $p2 = path("foo/bar/../baz")->realpath;
      if ( $p1->subsumes($p2) ) { ... }

      path("foo.txt")->touch;
      path("foo.txt")->touch($epoch_secs);
  
  Like the Unix C<touch> utility.  Creates the file if it doesn't exist, or else
  changes the modification and access times to the current time.  If the first
  argument is the epoch seconds then it will be used.
  
  Returns the path object so it can be easily chained with other methods:
  
      # won't die if foo.txt doesn't exist
      $content = path("foo.txt")->touch->slurp;
  
  Current API available since 0.015.
  
  =head2 touchpath
  
      path("bar/baz/foo.txt")->touchpath;
  
  Combines C<mkpath> and C<touch>.  Creates the parent directory if it doesn't exist,
  before touching the file.  Returns the path object like C<touch> does.
  
  Current API available since 0.022.
  
  =head2 visit
  
      path("/tmp")->visit( \&callback, \%options );
  
  Wraps the L</iterator> method to execute a callback for each directory entry.
  It returns a hash reference with any state accumulated during
  iteration.
  
  The options are the same as for L</iterator>: C<recurse> and
  C<follow_symlinks>.  Both default to false.
  
  The callback function will receive a C<Path::Tiny> object as the first argument
  and a hash reference to accumulate state as the second argument.  For example:
  
      # collect files sizes
      my $sizes = path("/tmp")->visit(
          sub {
              my ($path, $state) = @_;
              return if $path->is_dir;
              $state->{$path} = -s $path;
          },
          { recurse => 1 }
      );
  
  For convenience, the C<Path::Tiny> object will also be locally aliased as the
  C<$_> global variable:
  
      # print paths matching /foo/
      path("/tmp")->visit( sub { say if /foo/ }, { recurse => 1} );
  
  If the callback returns a B<reference> to a false scalar value, iteration will
  terminate.  This is not the same as "pruning" a directory search; this just
  stops all iteration and returns the state hash reference.
  
      # find up to 10 files larger than 100K
      my $files = path("/tmp")->visit(
          sub {
              my ($path, $state) = @_;
              $state->{$path}++ if -s $path > 102400
              return \0 if keys %$state == 10;
          },
          { recurse => 1 }
      );
  
  If you want more flexible iteration, use a module like L<Path::Iterator::Rule>.
  
  Current API available since 0.062.
  
  =head2 volume
  
      $vol = path("/tmp/foo.txt")->volume;   # ""
      $vol = path("C:/tmp/foo.txt")->volume; # "C:"
  
  Returns the volume portion of the path.  This is equivalent
  equivalent to what L<File::Spec> would give from C<splitpath> and thus
  usually is the empty string on Unix-like operating systems or the
  drive letter for an absolute path on C<MSWin32>.
  
  Current API available since 0.001.

  =head1 EXCEPTION HANDLING
  
  Simple usage errors will generally croak.  Failures of underlying Perl
  functions will be thrown as exceptions in the class
  C<Path::Tiny::Error>.
  
  A C<Path::Tiny::Error> object will be a hash reference with the following fields:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<op> — a description of the operation, usually function call and any extra info
  
  =item *
  
  C<file> — the file or directory relating to the error
  
  =item *
  
  C<err> — hold C<$!> at the time the error was thrown
  
  =item *
  
  C<msg> — a string combining the above data and a Carp-like short stack trace
  
  =back
  
  Exception objects will stringify as the C<msg> field.
  
  =head1 CAVEATS
  
  =head2 File locking
  
  If flock is not supported on a platform, it will not be used, even if
  locking is requested.
  
  See additional caveats below.
  
  =head3 NFS and BSD
  
  On BSD, Perl's flock implementation may not work to lock files on an
  NFS filesystem.  Path::Tiny has some heuristics to detect this
  and will warn once and let you continue in an unsafe mode.  If you
  want this failure to be fatal, you can fatalize the 'flock' warnings
  category:
  
      use warnings FATAL => 'flock';
  
  =head3 AIX and locking
  
  AIX requires a write handle for locking.  Therefore, calls that normally
  open a read handle and take a shared lock instead will open a read-write
  handle and take an exclusive lock.  If the user does not have write
  permission, no lock will be used.
  
  =head2 utf8 vs UTF-8
  
  All the C<*_utf8> methods use C<:encoding(UTF-8)> -- either as
  C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)> (unbuffered) or C<:raw:encoding(UTF-8)> (buffered) --
  which is strict against the Unicode spec and disallows illegal Unicode
  codepoints or UTF-8 sequences.
  
  Unfortunately, C<:encoding(UTF-8)> is very, very slow.  If you install
  L<Unicode::UTF8> 0.58 or later, that module will be used by some C<*_utf8>
  methods to encode or decode data after a raw, binary input/output operation,
  which is much faster.
  
  If you need the performance and can accept the security risk,
  C<< slurp({binmode => ":unix:utf8"}) >> will be faster than C<:unix:encoding(UTF-8)>
  (but not as fast as C<Unicode::UTF8>).
  
  Note that the C<*_utf8> methods read in B<raw> mode.  There is no CRLF
  translation on Windows.  If you must have CRLF translation, use the regular
  input/output methods with an appropriate binmode:
  
    $path->spew_utf8($data);                            # raw
    $path->spew({binmode => ":encoding(UTF-8)"}, $data; # LF -> CRLF
  
  Consider L<PerlIO::utf8_strict> for a faster L<PerlIO> layer alternative to
  C<:encoding(UTF-8)>, though it does not appear to be as fast as the
  C<Unicode::UTF8> approach.
  
  =head2 Default IO layers and the open pragma
  
  If you have Perl 5.10 or later, file input/output methods (C<slurp>, C<spew>,
  etc.) and high-level handle opening methods ( C<filehandle>, C<openr>,
  C<openw>, etc. ) respect default encodings set by the C<-C> switch or lexical
  L<open> settings of the caller.  For UTF-8, this is almost certainly slower
  than using the dedicated C<_utf8> methods if you have L<Unicode::UTF8>.
  
  =head1 TYPE CONSTRAINTS AND COERCION
  
  A standard L<MooseX::Types> library is available at
  L<MooseX::Types::Path::Tiny>.  A L<Type::Tiny> equivalent is available as
  L<Types::Path::Tiny>.
  
  =head1 SEE ALSO
  
  These are other file/path utilities, which may offer a different feature
  set than C<Path::Tiny>.

  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   package Syntax::Keyword::Gather;
  
   use Sub::Exporter::Progressive -setup => {
     exports => [qw( break gather gathered take )],
     groups => {
       default => [qw( break gather gathered take )],
     },
   };
  
   # elsewhere
  
   # uses Exporter for speed
   use Syntax::Keyword::Gather;
  
   # somewhere else
  
   # uses Sub::Exporter for features
   use Syntax::Keyword::Gather 'gather', take => { -as => 'grab' };
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  L<Sub::Exporter> is an incredibly powerful module, but with that power comes
  great responsibility, er- as well as some runtime penalties.  This module
  is a C<Sub::Exporter> wrapper that will let your users just use L<Exporter>
  if all they are doing is picking exports, but use C<Sub::Exporter> if your
  users try to use C<Sub::Exporter>'s more advanced features, like
  renaming exports, if they try to use them.
  
  Note that this module will export C<@EXPORT>, C<@EXPORT_OK> and
  C<%EXPORT_TAGS> package variables for C<Exporter> to work.  Additionally, if
  your package uses advanced C<Sub::Exporter> features like currying, this module
  will only ever use C<Sub::Exporter>, so you might as well use it directly.

  =head1 SYNOPSIS

  conditions, avoiding quirks in Perl and common mistakes:
  
    # handle errors with a catch handler
    try {
      die "foo";
    } catch {
      warn "caught error: $_"; # not $@
    };
  
  You can also use it like a standalone C<eval> to catch and ignore any error
  conditions.  Obviously, this is an extreme measure not to be undertaken
  lightly:
  
    # just silence errors
    try {
      die "foo";
    };
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides bare bones C<try>/C<catch>/C<finally> statements that are designed to
  minimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.
  
  This is unlike L<TryCatch> which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding
  another call stack layer, and supports calling C<return> from the C<try> block to
  return from the parent subroutine. These extra features come at a cost of a few
  dependencies, namely L<Devel::Declare> and L<Scope::Upper> which are
  occasionally problematic, and the additional catch filtering uses L<Moose>
  type constraints which may not be desirable either.
  
  The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error handling
  for those having a hard time installing L<TryCatch>, but who still want to
  write correct C<eval> blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each time.
  
  It's designed to work as correctly as possible in light of the various
  pathological edge cases (see L</BACKGROUND>) and to be compatible with any style
  of error values (simple strings, references, objects, overloaded objects, etc).
  
  If the C<try> block dies, it returns the value of the last statement executed in
  the C<catch> block, if there is one. Otherwise, it returns C<undef> in scalar
  context or the empty list in list context. The following examples all
  assign C<"bar"> to C<$x>:
  
    my $x = try { die "foo" } catch { "bar" };
    my $x = try { die "foo" } || { "bar" };
    my $x = (try { die "foo" }) // { "bar" };
  
    my $x = eval { die "foo" } || "bar";
  
  You can add C<finally> blocks, yielding the following:
  
    my $x;
    try { die 'foo' } finally { $x = 'bar' };
    try { die 'foo' } catch { warn "Got a die: $_" } finally { $x = 'bar' };
  
  C<finally> blocks are always executed making them suitable for cleanup code
  which cannot be handled using local.  You can add as many C<finally> blocks to a
  given C<try> block as you like.
  
  Note that adding a C<finally> block without a preceding C<catch> block
  suppresses any errors. This behaviour is consistent with using a standalone
  C<eval>, but it is not consistent with C<try>/C<finally> patterns found in
  other programming languages, such as Java, Python, Javascript or C#. If you
  learnt the C<try>/C<finally> pattern from one of these languages, watch out for
  this.
  
  =head1 EXPORTS
  
  All functions are exported by default using L<Exporter>.
  
  If you need to rename the C<try>, C<catch> or C<finally> keyword consider using
  L<Sub::Import> to get L<Sub::Exporter>'s flexibility.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item try (&;@)
  
  Takes one mandatory C<try> subroutine, an optional C<catch> subroutine and C<finally>
  subroutine.
  
  The mandatory subroutine is evaluated in the context of an C<eval> block.
  
  If no error occurred the value from the first block is returned, preserving
  list/scalar context.
  
  If there was an error and the second subroutine was given it will be invoked
  with the error in C<$_> (localized) and as that block's first and only
  argument.
  
  C<$@> does B<not> contain the error. Inside the C<catch> block it has the same
  value it had before the C<try> block was executed.
  
  Note that the error may be false, but if that happens the C<catch> block will
  still be invoked.
  
  Once all execution is finished then the C<finally> block, if given, will execute.
  
  =item catch (&;@)
  
  Intended to be used in the second argument position of C<try>.
  
  Returns a reference to the subroutine it was given but blessed as
  C<Try::Tiny::Catch> which allows try to decode correctly what to do
  with this code reference.
  
    catch { ... }
  
  Inside the C<catch> block the caught error is stored in C<$_>, while previous
  value of C<$@> is still available for use.  This value may or may not be
  meaningful depending on what happened before the C<try>, but it might be a good
  idea to preserve it in an error stack.
  
  For code that captures C<$@> when throwing new errors (i.e.
  L<Class::Throwable>), you'll need to do:
  
    local $@ = $_;
  
  =item finally (&;@)
  
    try     { ... }
    catch   { ... }
    finally { ... };
  
  Or
  
    try     { ... }
    finally { ... };
  
  Or even
  
    try     { ... }
    finally { ... }
    catch   { ... };
  
  Intended to be the second or third element of C<try>. C<finally> blocks are always
  executed in the event of a successful C<try> or if C<catch> is run. This allows
  you to locate cleanup code which cannot be done via C<local()> e.g. closing a file
  handle.
  
  When invoked, the C<finally> block is passed the error that was caught.  If no
  error was caught, it is passed nothing.  (Note that the C<finally> block does not
  localize C<$_> with the error, since unlike in a C<catch> block, there is no way
  to know if C<$_ == undef> implies that there were no errors.) In other words,
  the following code does just what you would expect:
  
    try {
      die_sometimes();
    } catch {
      # ...code run in case of error
    } finally {
      if (@_) {
        print "The try block died with: @_\n";
      } else {
        print "The try block ran without error.\n";
      }
    };
  
  B<You must always do your own error handling in the C<finally> block>. C<Try::Tiny> will
  not do anything about handling possible errors coming from code located in these
  blocks.
  
  Furthermore B<exceptions in C<finally> blocks are not trappable and are unable
  to influence the execution of your program>. This is due to limitation of
  C<DESTROY>-based scope guards, which C<finally> is implemented on top of. This
  may change in a future version of Try::Tiny.
  
  In the same way C<catch()> blesses the code reference this subroutine does the same
  except it bless them as C<Try::Tiny::Finally>.

  =head1 BACKGROUND
  
  There are a number of issues with C<eval>.
  
  =head2 Clobbering $@
  
  When you run an C<eval> block and it succeeds, C<$@> will be cleared, potentially
  clobbering an error that is currently being caught.
  
  This causes action at a distance, clearing previous errors your caller may have
  not yet handled.
  
  C<$@> must be properly localized before invoking C<eval> in order to avoid this
  issue.
  
  More specifically, C<$@> is clobbered at the beginning of the C<eval>, which
  also makes it impossible to capture the previous error before you die (for
  instance when making exception objects with error stacks).
  
  For this reason C<try> will actually set C<$@> to its previous value (the one
  available before entering the C<try> block) in the beginning of the C<eval>
  block.
  
  =head2 Localizing $@ silently masks errors
  
  Inside an C<eval> block, C<die> behaves sort of like:
  
    sub die {
      $@ = $_[0];
      return_undef_from_eval();
    }
  
  This means that if you were polite and localized C<$@> you can't die in that
  scope, or your error will be discarded (printing "Something's wrong" instead).
  
  The workaround is very ugly:
  
    my $error = do {
      local $@;
      eval { ... };
      $@;
    };
  
    ...
    die $error;
  
  =head2 $@ might not be a true value
  
  This code is wrong:
  
    if ( $@ ) {
      ...
    }
  
  because due to the previous caveats it may have been unset.
  
  C<$@> could also be an overloaded error object that evaluates to false, but
  that's asking for trouble anyway.
  
  The classic failure mode is:
  
    sub Object::DESTROY {
      eval { ... }
    }
  
    eval {
      my $obj = Object->new;
  
      die "foo";
    };
  
    if ( $@ ) {
  
    }
  
  In this case since C<Object::DESTROY> is not localizing C<$@> but still uses
  C<eval>, it will set C<$@> to C<"">.
  
  The destructor is called when the stack is unwound, after C<die> sets C<$@> to
  C<"foo at Foo.pm line 42\n">, so by the time C<if ( $@ )> is evaluated it has
  been cleared by C<eval> in the destructor.
  
  The workaround for this is even uglier than the previous ones. Even though we
  can't save the value of C<$@> from code that doesn't localize, we can at least
  be sure the C<eval> was aborted due to an error:
  
    my $failed = not eval {
      ...
  
      return 1;
    };
  
  This is because an C<eval> that caught a C<die> will always return a false
  value.
  
  =head1 SHINY SYNTAX
  
  Using Perl 5.10 you can use L<perlsyn/"Switch statements">.
  
  The C<catch> block is invoked in a topicalizer context (like a C<given> block),
  but note that you can't return a useful value from C<catch> using the C<when>
  blocks without an explicit C<return>.
  
  This is somewhat similar to Perl 6's C<CATCH> blocks. You can use it to
  concisely match errors:
  
    try {
      require Foo;
    } catch {
      when (/^Can't locate .*?\.pm in \@INC/) { } # ignore
      default { die $_ }
    };
  
  =head1 CAVEATS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<@_> is not available within the C<try> block, so you need to copy your
  arglist. In case you want to work with argument values directly via C<@_>
  aliasing (i.e. allow C<$_[1] = "foo">), you need to pass C<@_> by reference:
  
    sub foo {
      my ( $self, @args ) = @_;
      try { $self->bar(@args) }
    }
  
  or
  
    sub bar_in_place {
      my $self = shift;
      my $args = \@_;
      try { $_ = $self->bar($_) for @$args }
    }
  
  =item *
  
  C<return> returns from the C<try> block, not from the parent sub (note that
  this is also how C<eval> works, but not how L<TryCatch> works):
  
    sub parent_sub {
      try {
        die;
      }
      catch {
        return;
      };
  
      say "this text WILL be displayed, even though an exception is thrown";
    }
  
  Instead, you should capture the return value:
  
    sub parent_sub {
      my $success = try {
        die;
        1;
      };
      return unless $success;
  
      say "This text WILL NEVER appear!";
    }
    # OR
    sub parent_sub_with_catch {
      my $success = try {
        die;
        1;
      }
      catch {
        # do something with $_
        return undef; #see note
      };
      return unless $success;
  
      say "This text WILL NEVER appear!";
    }
  
  Note that if you have a C<catch> block, it must return C<undef> for this to work,
  since if a C<catch> block exists, its return value is returned in place of C<undef>
  when an exception is thrown.
  
  =item *
  
  C<try> introduces another caller stack frame. L<Sub::Uplevel> is not used. L<Carp>
  will not report this when using full stack traces, though, because
  C<%Carp::Internal> is used. This lack of magic is considered a feature.
  
  =item *
  
  The value of C<$_> in the C<catch> block is not guaranteed to be the value of
  the exception thrown (C<$@>) in the C<try> block.  There is no safe way to
  ensure this, since C<eval> may be used unhygenically in destructors.  The only
  guarantee is that the C<catch> will be called if an exception is thrown.
  
  =item *
  
  The return value of the C<catch> block is not ignored, so if testing the result
  of the expression for truth on success, be sure to return a false value from
  the C<catch> block:
  
    my $obj = try {
      MightFail->new;
    } catch {
      ...
  
      return; # avoid returning a true value;
    };
  
    return unless $obj;
  
  =item *
  
  C<$SIG{__DIE__}> is still in effect.
  
  Though it can be argued that C<$SIG{__DIE__}> should be disabled inside of
  C<eval> blocks, since it isn't people have grown to rely on it. Therefore in
  the interests of compatibility, C<try> does not disable C<$SIG{__DIE__}> for
  the scope of the error throwing code.
  
  =item *
  
  Lexical C<$_> may override the one set by C<catch>.
  
  For example Perl 5.10's C<given> form uses a lexical C<$_>, creating some
  confusing behavior:
  
    given ($foo) {
      when (...) {
        try {
          ...
        } catch {
          warn $_; # will print $foo, not the error
          warn $_[0]; # instead, get the error like this
        }
      }
    }
  
  Note that this behavior was changed once again in L<Perl5 version 18
  |https://metacpan.org/module/perldelta#given-now-aliases-the-global-_>.
  However, since the entirety of lexical C<$_> is now L<considired experimental
  |https://metacpan.org/module/perldelta#Lexical-_-is-now-experimental>, it
  is unclear whether the new version 18 behavior is final.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Types::Serialiser - simple data types for common serialisation formats
  
  =encoding utf-8
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides some extra datatypes that are used by common
  serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a
  repository of simple/small constants and containers that can be shared by
  different implementations so they become interoperable between each other.
  
  =cut
  
  package Types::Serialiser;
  
  use common::sense; # required to suppress annoying warnings
  
  our $VERSION = '1.0';
  
  =head1 SIMPLE SCALAR CONSTANTS
  
  Simple scalar constants are values that are overloaded to act like simple
  Perl values, but have (class) type to differentiate them from normal Perl
  scalars. This is necessary because these have different representations in
  the serialisation formats.
  
  =head2 BOOLEANS (Types::Serialiser::Boolean class)
  
  This type has only two instances, true and false. A natural representation
  for these in Perl is C<1> and C<0>, but serialisation formats need to be
  able to differentiate between them and mere numbers.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $Types::Serialiser::true, Types::Serialiser::true
  
  This value represents the "true" value. In most contexts is acts like
  the number C<1>. It is up to you whether you use the variable form
  (C<$Types::Serialiser::true>) or the constant form (C<Types::Serialiser::true>).
  
  The constant is represented as a reference to a scalar containing C<1> -
  implementations are allowed to directly test for this.
  
  =item $Types::Serialiser::false, Types::Serialiser::false
  
  This value represents the "false" value. In most contexts is acts like
  the number C<0>. It is up to you whether you use the variable form
  (C<$Types::Serialiser::false>) or the constant form (C<Types::Serialiser::false>).
  
  The constant is represented as a reference to a scalar containing C<0> -
  implementations are allowed to directly test for this.
  
  =item $is_bool = Types::Serialiser::is_bool $value
  
  Returns true iff the C<$value> is either C<$Types::Serialiser::true> or
  C<$Types::Serialiser::false>.
  
  For example, you could differentiate between a perl true value and a
  C<Types::Serialiser::true> by using this:
  
     $value && Types::Serialiser::is_bool $value
  
  =item $is_true = Types::Serialiser::is_true $value
  
  Returns true iff C<$value> is C<$Types::Serialiser::true>.
  
  =item $is_false = Types::Serialiser::is_false $value
  
  Returns false iff C<$value> is C<$Types::Serialiser::false>.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 ERROR (Types::Serialiser::Error class)
  
  This class has only a single instance, C<error>. It is used to signal
  an encoding or decoding error. In CBOR for example, and object that
  couldn't be encoded will be represented by a CBOR undefined value, which
  is represented by the error value in Perl.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $Types::Serialiser::error, Types::Serialiser::error
  
  This value represents the "error" value. Accessing values of this type
  will throw an exception.
  
  The constant is represented as a reference to a scalar containing C<undef>
  - implementations are allowed to directly test for this.
  
  =item $is_error = Types::Serialiser::is_error $value
  
  Returns false iff C<$value> is C<$Types::Serialiser::error>.

  =head1 NOTES FOR XS USERS
  
  The recommended way to detect whether a scalar is one of these objects
  is to check whether the stash is the C<Types::Serialiser::Boolean> or
  C<Types::Serialiser::Error> stash, and then follow the scalar reference to
  see if it's C<1> (true), C<0> (false) or C<undef> (error).
  
  While it is possible to use an isa test, directly comparing stash pointers
  is faster and guaranteed to work.
  
  For historical reasons, the C<Types::Serialiser::Boolean> stash is
  just an alias for C<JSON::PP::Boolean>. When printed, the classname
  with usually be C<JSON::PP::Boolean>, but isa tests and stash pointer
  comparison will normally work correctly (i.e. Types::Serialiser::true ISA
  JSON::PP::Boolean, but also ISA Types::Serialiser::Boolean).
  
  =head1 A GENERIC OBJECT SERIALIATION PROTOCOL
  
  This section explains the object serialisation protocol used by
  L<CBOR::XS>. It is meant to be generic enough to support any kind of
  generic object serialiser.
  
  This protocol is called "the Types::Serialiser object serialisation
  protocol".
  
  =head2 ENCODING
  
  When the encoder encounters an object that it cannot otherwise encode (for
  example, L<CBOR::XS> can encode a few special types itself, and will first
  attempt to use the special C<TO_CBOR> serialisation protocol), it will
  look up the C<FREEZE> method on the object.
  
  Note that the C<FREEZE> method will normally be called I<during> encoding,
  and I<MUST NOT> change the data structure that is being encoded in any
  way, or it might cause memory corruption or worse.
  
  If it exists, it will call it with two arguments: the object to serialise,
  and a constant string that indicates the name of the data model. For
  example L<CBOR::XS> uses C<CBOR>, and the L<JSON> and L<JSON::XS> modules
  (or any other JSON serialiser), would use C<JSON> as second argument.
  
  The C<FREEZE> method can then return zero or more values to identify the
  object instance. The serialiser is then supposed to encode the class name
  and all of these return values (which must be encodable in the format)
  using the relevant form for Perl objects. In CBOR for example, there is a
  registered tag number for encoded perl objects.
  
  The values that C<FREEZE> returns must be serialisable with the serialiser
  that calls it. Therefore, it is recommended to use simple types such as
  strings and numbers, and maybe array references and hashes (basically, the
  JSON data model). You can always use a more complex format for a specific
  data model by checking the second argument, the data model.
  
  The "data model" is not the same as the "data format" - the data model
  indicates what types and kinds of return values can be returned from
  C<FREEZE>. For example, in C<CBOR> it is permissible to return tagged CBOR
  values, while JSON does not support these at all, so C<JSON> would be a
  valid (but too limited) data model name for C<CBOR::XS>. similarly, a
  serialising format that supports more or less the same data model as JSON
  could use C<JSON> as data model without losing anything.
  
  =head2 DECODING
  
  When the decoder then encounters such an encoded perl object, it should
  look up the C<THAW> method on the stored classname, and invoke it with the
  classname, the constant string to identify the data model/data format, and
  all the return values returned by C<FREEZE>.
  
  =head2 EXAMPLES
  
  See the C<OBJECT SERIALISATION> section in the L<CBOR::XS> manpage for
  more details, an example implementation, and code examples.
  
  Here is an example C<FREEZE>/C<THAW> method pair:
  
     sub My::Object::FREEZE {
        my ($self, $model) = @_;
  
        ($self->{type}, $self->{id}, $self->{variant})

  =head1 NAME
  
  parent - Establish an ISA relationship with base classes at compile time
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      package Baz;
      use parent qw(Foo Bar);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up inheritance from
  those modules at the same time.  Mostly similar in effect to
  
      package Baz;
      BEGIN {
          require Foo;
          require Bar;
          push @ISA, qw(Foo Bar);
      }
  
  By default, every base class needs to live in a file of its own.
  If you want to have a subclass and its parent class in the same file, you
  can tell C<parent> not to load any modules by using the C<-norequire> switch:
  
    package Foo;
    sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }
  
    package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
    use parent -norequire, 'Foo', 'Bar';
    # will not go looking for Foo.pm or Bar.pm
  
  This is equivalent to the following code:
  
    package Foo;
    sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }
  
    package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
    push @DoesNotLoadFooBar::ISA, 'Foo', 'Bar';
  
  This is also helpful for the case where a package lives within
  a differently named file:
  
    package MyHash;
    use Tie::Hash;
    use parent -norequire, 'Tie::StdHash';
  
  This is equivalent to the following code:
  
    package MyHash;
    require Tie::Hash;
    push @ISA, 'Tie::StdHash';
  
  If you want to load a subclass from a file that C<require> would
  not consider an eligible filename (that is, it does not end in
  either C<.pm> or C<.pmc>), use the following code:
  
    package MySecondPlugin;
    require './plugins/custom.plugin'; # contains Plugin::Custom
    use parent -norequire, 'Plugin::Custom';

$fatpacked{"Cwd.pm"} = '#line '.(1+__LINE__).' "'.__FILE__."\"\n".<<'X86_64-LINUX-GNU-THREAD-MULTI_CWD';
  package Cwd;
  
  =head1 NAME
  
  Cwd - get pathname of current working directory
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Cwd;
      my $dir = getcwd;
  
      use Cwd 'abs_path';
      my $abs_path = abs_path($file);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides functions for determining the pathname of the
  current working directory.  It is recommended that getcwd (or another
  *cwd() function) be used in I<all> code to ensure portability.
  
  By default, it exports the functions cwd(), getcwd(), fastcwd(), and
  fastgetcwd() (and, on Win32, getdcwd()) into the caller's namespace.  
  
  
  =head2 getcwd and friends
  
  Each of these functions are called without arguments and return the
  absolute path of the current working directory.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item getcwd
  
      my $cwd = getcwd();
  
  Returns the current working directory.
  
  Exposes the POSIX function getcwd(3) or re-implements it if it's not
  available.
  
  =item cwd
  
      my $cwd = cwd();
  
  The cwd() is the most natural form for the current architecture.  For
  most systems it is identical to `pwd` (but without the trailing line
  terminator).
  
  =item fastcwd
  
      my $cwd = fastcwd();
  
  A more dangerous version of getcwd(), but potentially faster.
  
  It might conceivably chdir() you out of a directory that it can't
  chdir() you back into.  If fastcwd encounters a problem it will return
  undef but will probably leave you in a different directory.  For a
  measure of extra security, if everything appears to have worked, the
  fastcwd() function will check that it leaves you in the same directory
  that it started in.  If it has changed it will C<die> with the message
  "Unstable directory path, current directory changed
  unexpectedly".  That should never happen.
  
  =item fastgetcwd
  
    my $cwd = fastgetcwd();
  
  The fastgetcwd() function is provided as a synonym for cwd().
  
  =item getdcwd
  
      my $cwd = getdcwd();
      my $cwd = getdcwd('C:');
  
  The getdcwd() function is also provided on Win32 to get the current working
  directory on the specified drive, since Windows maintains a separate current
  working directory for each drive.  If no drive is specified then the current
  drive is assumed.
  
  This function simply calls the Microsoft C library _getdcwd() function.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 abs_path and friends
  
  These functions are exported only on request.  They each take a single
  argument and return the absolute pathname for it.  If no argument is
  given they'll use the current working directory.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item abs_path
  
    my $abs_path = abs_path($file);
  
  Uses the same algorithm as getcwd().  Symbolic links and relative-path
  components ("." and "..") are resolved to return the canonical
  pathname, just like realpath(3).
  
  =item realpath
  
    my $abs_path = realpath($file);
  
  A synonym for abs_path().
  
  =item fast_abs_path
  
    my $abs_path = fast_abs_path($file);
  
  A more dangerous, but potentially faster version of abs_path.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 $ENV{PWD}
  
  If you ask to override your chdir() built-in function, 
  
    use Cwd qw(chdir);
  
  then your PWD environment variable will be kept up to date.  Note that
  it will only be kept up to date if all packages which use chdir import
  it from Cwd.
  
  
  =head1 NOTES
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  Since the path separators are different on some operating systems ('/'
  on Unix, ':' on MacPerl, etc...) we recommend you use the File::Spec
  modules wherever portability is a concern.
  
  =item *
  
  Actually, on Mac OS, the C<getcwd()>, C<fastgetcwd()> and C<fastcwd()>
  functions are all aliases for the C<cwd()> function, which, on Mac OS,
  calls `pwd`.  Likewise, the C<abs_path()> function is an alias for
  C<fast_abs_path()>.

  =head1 NAME
  
  File::Spec - portably perform operations on file names
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  	use File::Spec;
  
  	$x=File::Spec->catfile('a', 'b', 'c');
  
  which returns 'a/b/c' under Unix. Or:
  
  	use File::Spec::Functions;
  
  	$x = catfile('a', 'b', 'c');
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module is designed to support operations commonly performed on file
  specifications (usually called "file names", but not to be confused with the
  contents of a file, or Perl's file handles), such as concatenating several
  directory and file names into a single path, or determining whether a path
  is rooted. It is based on code directly taken from MakeMaker 5.17, code
  written by Andreas KE<ouml>nig, Andy Dougherty, Charles Bailey, Ilya
  Zakharevich, Paul Schinder, and others.
  
  Since these functions are different for most operating systems, each set of
  OS specific routines is available in a separate module, including:
  
  	File::Spec::Unix
  	File::Spec::Mac
  	File::Spec::OS2
  	File::Spec::Win32
  	File::Spec::VMS
  
  The module appropriate for the current OS is automatically loaded by
  File::Spec. Since some modules (like VMS) make use of facilities available
  only under that OS, it may not be possible to load all modules under all
  operating systems.
  
  Since File::Spec is object oriented, subroutines should not be called directly,
  as in:
  
  	File::Spec::catfile('a','b');
  
  but rather as class methods:
  
  	File::Spec->catfile('a','b');
  
  For simple uses, L<File::Spec::Functions> provides convenient functional
  forms of these methods.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =over 2
  
  =item canonpath
  X<canonpath>
  
  No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
  path.
  
      $cpath = File::Spec->canonpath( $path ) ;
  
  Note that this does *not* collapse F<x/../y> sections into F<y>.  This
  is by design.  If F</foo> on your system is a symlink to F</bar/baz>,
  then F</foo/../quux> is actually F</bar/quux>, not F</quux> as a naive
  F<../>-removal would give you.  If you want to do this kind of
  processing, you probably want C<Cwd>'s C<realpath()> function to
  actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.
  
  =item catdir
  X<catdir>
  
  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending
  with a directory. But remove the trailing slash from the resulting
  string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and confuses
  OS/2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the
  trailing slash :-)
  
      $path = File::Spec->catdir( @directories );
  
  =item catfile
  X<catfile>
  
  Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a
  complete path ending with a filename
  
      $path = File::Spec->catfile( @directories, $filename );
  
  =item curdir
  X<curdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the current directory.
  
      $curdir = File::Spec->curdir();
  
  =item devnull
  X<devnull>
  
  Returns a string representation of the null device.
  
      $devnull = File::Spec->devnull();
  
  =item rootdir
  X<rootdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the root directory.
  
      $rootdir = File::Spec->rootdir();
  
  =item tmpdir
  X<tmpdir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from a
  list of possible temporary directories.  Returns the current directory
  if no writable temporary directories are found.  The list of directories
  checked depends on the platform; e.g. File::Spec::Unix checks C<$ENV{TMPDIR}>
  (unless taint is on) and F</tmp>.
  
      $tmpdir = File::Spec->tmpdir();
  
  =item updir
  X<updir>
  
  Returns a string representation of the parent directory.
  
      $updir = File::Spec->updir();
  
  =item no_upwards
  
  Given a list of file names, strip out those that refer to a parent
  directory. (Does not strip symlinks, only '.', '..', and equivalents.)
  
      @paths = File::Spec->no_upwards( @paths );
  
  =item case_tolerant
  
  Returns a true or false value indicating, respectively, that alphabetic
  case is not or is significant when comparing file specifications.
  Cygwin and Win32 accept an optional drive argument.
  
      $is_case_tolerant = File::Spec->case_tolerant();
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as its argument a path, and returns true if it is an absolute path.
  
      $is_absolute = File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute( $path );
  
  This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2, or
  Mac OS (Classic).  It does consult the working environment for VMS
  (see L<File::Spec::VMS/file_name_is_absolute>).
  
  =item path
  X<path>
  
  Takes no argument.  Returns the environment variable C<PATH> (or the local
  platform's equivalent) as a list.
  
      @PATH = File::Spec->path();
  
  =item join
  X<join, path>
  
  join is the same as catfile.
  
  =item splitpath
  X<splitpath> X<split, path>
  
  Splits a path in to volume, directory, and filename portions. On systems
  with no concept of volume, returns '' for volume. 
  
      ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                         File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
      ($volume,$directories,$file) =
                         File::Spec->splitpath( $path, $no_file );
  
  For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, 
  assumes that the last file is a path unless C<$no_file> is true or a
  trailing separator or F</.> or F</..> is present. On Unix, this means that C<$no_file>
  true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).
  
  The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.
  
  The results can be passed to L</catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.
  
  =item splitdir
  X<splitdir> X<split, dir>
  
  The opposite of L</catdir>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  C<$directories> must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty
  directory names (C<''>) can be returned, because these are significant
  on some OSes.
  
  =item catpath()
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
  Unix, C<$volume> is ignored, and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is
  inserted if need be.  On other OSes, C<$volume> is significant.
  
      $full_path = File::Spec->catpath( $volume, $directory, $file );
  
  =item abs2rel
  X<abs2rel> X<absolute, path> X<relative, path>
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If C<$base> is not present or '', then L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd> is used. If C<$base> is
  relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
  L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
  L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems with the concept of volume, if C<$path> and C<$base> appear to be
  on two different volumes, we will not attempt to resolve the two
  paths, and we will instead simply return C<$path>.  Note that previous
  versions of this module ignored the volume of C<$base>, which resulted in
  garbage results part of the time.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  C<$base> filename as well. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If C<$path> is relative, it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.

  =item rel2abs()
  X<rel2abs> X<absolute, path> X<relative, path>
  
  Converts a relative path to an absolute path. 
  
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path ) ;
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If C<$base> is not present or '', then L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd> is used. If C<$base> is relative,
  then it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>. This means that it
  is taken to be relative to L<Cwd::cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems with the concept of volume, if C<$path> and C<$base> appear to be
  on two different volumes, we will not attempt to resolve the two
  paths, and we will instead simply return C<$path>.  Note that previous
  versions of this module ignored the volume of C<$base>, which resulted in
  garbage results part of the time.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  C<$base> filename as well. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If C<$path> is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using L</canonpath>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
  interaction with the working environment, as logicals and
  macros are expanded.

  File::Spec::Mac - File::Spec for Mac OS (Classic)
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   require File::Spec::Mac; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Methods for manipulating file specifications.
  
  =head1 METHODS
  
  =over 2
  
  =item canonpath
  
  On Mac OS, there's nothing to be done. Returns what it's given.
  
  =cut
  
  sub canonpath {
      my ($self,$path) = @_;
      return $path;
  }
  
  =item catdir()
  
  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a path separated by colons
  (":") ending with a directory. Resulting paths are B<relative> by default,
  but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this, see below). Automatically
  puts a trailing ":" on the end of the complete path, because that's what's
  done in MacPerl's environment and helps to distinguish a file path from a
  directory path.
  
  B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the resulting
  path is relative by default and I<not> absolute. This decision was made due
  to portability reasons. Since C<File::Spec-E<gt>catdir()> returns relative paths
  on all other operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac
  OS. Note that this may break some existing scripts.
  
  The intended purpose of this routine is to concatenate I<directory names>.
  But because of the nature of Macintosh paths, some additional possibilities
  are allowed to make using this routine give reasonable results for some
  common situations. In other words, you are also allowed to concatenate
  I<paths> instead of directory names (strictly speaking, a string like ":a"
  is a path, but not a name, since it contains a punctuation character ":").
  
  So, beside calls like
  
      catdir("a") = ":a:"
      catdir("a","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir() = ""                    (special case)
  
  calls like the following
  
      catdir(":a:") = ":a:"
      catdir(":a","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":a:","b") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":a:",":b:") = ":a:b:"
      catdir(":") = ":"
  
  are allowed.
  
  Here are the rules that are used in C<catdir()>; note that we try to be as
  compatible as possible to Unix:
  
  =over 2
  
  =item 1.
  
  The resulting path is relative by default, i.e. the resulting path will have a
  leading colon.
  
  =item 2.
  
  A trailing colon is added automatically to the resulting path, to denote a
  directory.
  
  =item 3.
  
  Generally, each argument has one leading ":" and one trailing ":"
  removed (if any). They are then joined together by a ":". Special
  treatment applies for arguments denoting updir paths like "::lib:",
  see (4), or arguments consisting solely of colons ("colon paths"),
  see (5).
  
  =item 4.
  
  When an updir path like ":::lib::" is passed as argument, the number
  of directories to climb up is handled correctly, not removing leading
  or trailing colons when necessary. E.g.
  
      catdir(":::a","::b","c")    = ":::a::b:c:"
      catdir(":::a::","::b","c")  = ":::a:::b:c:"
  
  =item 5.
  
  Adding a colon ":" or empty string "" to a path at I<any> position
  doesn't alter the path, i.e. these arguments are ignored. (When a ""
  is passed as the first argument, it has a special meaning, see
  (6)). This way, a colon ":" is handled like a "." (curdir) on Unix,
  while an empty string "" is generally ignored (see
  C<Unix-E<gt>canonpath()> ). Likewise, a "::" is handled like a ".."
  (updir), and a ":::" is handled like a "../.." etc.  E.g.
  
      catdir("a",":",":","b")   = ":a:b:"
      catdir("a",":","::",":b") = ":a::b:"
  
  =item 6.
  
  If the first argument is an empty string "" or is a volume name, i.e. matches
  the pattern /^[^:]+:/, the resulting path is B<absolute>.
  
  =item 7.
  
  Passing an empty string "" as the first argument to C<catdir()> is
  like passingC<File::Spec-E<gt>rootdir()> as the first argument, i.e.
  
      catdir("","a","b")          is the same as
  
      catdir(rootdir(),"a","b").
  
  This is true on Unix, where C<catdir("","a","b")> yields "/a/b" and
  C<rootdir()> is "/". Note that C<rootdir()> on Mac OS is the startup
  volume, which is the closest in concept to Unix' "/". This should help
  to run existing scripts originally written for Unix.
  
  =item 8.
  
  For absolute paths, some cleanup is done, to ensure that the volume
  name isn't immediately followed by updirs. This is invalid, because
  this would go beyond "root". Generally, these cases are handled like
  their Unix counterparts:
  
   Unix:
      Unix->catdir("","")                 =  "/"
      Unix->catdir("",".")                =  "/"
      Unix->catdir("","..")               =  "/"        # can't go
                                                        # beyond root
      Unix->catdir("",".","..","..","a")  =  "/a"
   Mac:
      Mac->catdir("","")                  =  rootdir()  # (e.g. "HD:")
      Mac->catdir("",":")                 =  rootdir()
      Mac->catdir("","::")                =  rootdir()  # can't go
                                                        # beyond root
      Mac->catdir("",":","::","::","a")   =  rootdir() . "a:"
                                                      # (e.g. "HD:a:")
  
  However, this approach is limited to the first arguments following
  "root" (again, see C<Unix-E<gt>canonpath()> ). If there are more
  arguments that move up the directory tree, an invalid path going
  beyond root can be created.
  
  =back
  
  As you've seen, you can force C<catdir()> to create an absolute path
  by passing either an empty string or a path that begins with a volume
  name as the first argument. However, you are strongly encouraged not
  to do so, since this is done only for backward compatibility. Newer
  versions of File::Spec come with a method called C<catpath()> (see
  below), that is designed to offer a portable solution for the creation
  of absolute paths.  It takes volume, directory and file portions and
  returns an entire path. While C<catdir()> is still suitable for the
  concatenation of I<directory names>, you are encouraged to use
  C<catpath()> to concatenate I<volume names> and I<directory
  paths>. E.g.
  
      $dir      = File::Spec->catdir("tmp","sources");
      $abs_path = File::Spec->catpath("MacintoshHD:", $dir,"");
  
  yields
  
      "MacintoshHD:tmp:sources:" .

  =item catfile
  
  Concatenate one or more directory names and a filename to form a
  complete path ending with a filename. Resulting paths are B<relative>
  by default, but can be forced to be absolute (but avoid this).
  
  B<IMPORTANT NOTE:> Beginning with version 1.3 of this module, the
  resulting path is relative by default and I<not> absolute. This
  decision was made due to portability reasons. Since
  C<File::Spec-E<gt>catfile()> returns relative paths on all other
  operating systems, it will now also follow this convention on Mac OS.
  Note that this may break some existing scripts.
  
  The last argument is always considered to be the file portion. Since
  C<catfile()> uses C<catdir()> (see above) for the concatenation of the
  directory portions (if any), the following with regard to relative and
  absolute paths is true:
  
      catfile("")     = ""
      catfile("file") = "file"
  
  but
  
      catfile("","")        = rootdir()         # (e.g. "HD:")
      catfile("","file")    = rootdir() . file  # (e.g. "HD:file")
      catfile("HD:","file") = "HD:file"
  
  This means that C<catdir()> is called only when there are two or more
  arguments, as one might expect.
  
  Note that the leading ":" is removed from the filename, so that
  
      catfile("a","b","file")  = ":a:b:file"    and
  
      catfile("a","b",":file") = ":a:b:file"
  
  give the same answer.
  
  To concatenate I<volume names>, I<directory paths> and I<filenames>,
  you are encouraged to use C<catpath()> (see below).

  =item curdir
  
  Returns a string representing the current directory. On Mac OS, this is ":".
  
  =cut
  
  sub curdir {
      return ":";
  }
  
  =item devnull
  
  Returns a string representing the null device. On Mac OS, this is "Dev:Null".
  
  =cut
  
  sub devnull {
      return "Dev:Null";
  }
  
  =item rootdir
  
  Returns a string representing the root directory.  Under MacPerl,
  returns the name of the startup volume, since that's the closest in
  concept, although other volumes aren't rooted there. The name has a
  trailing ":", because that's the correct specification for a volume
  name on Mac OS.
  
  If Mac::Files could not be loaded, the empty string is returned.
  
  =cut
  
  sub rootdir {
  #
  #  There's no real root directory on Mac OS. The name of the startup
  #  volume is returned, since that's the closest in concept.
  #
      return '' unless $macfiles;

  	&Mac::Files::kSystemFolderType);
      $system =~ s/:.*\Z(?!\n)/:/s;
      return $system;
  }
  
  =item tmpdir
  
  Returns the contents of $ENV{TMPDIR}, if that directory exits or the
  current working directory otherwise. Under MacPerl, $ENV{TMPDIR} will
  contain a path like "MacintoshHD:Temporary Items:", which is a hidden
  directory on your startup volume.
  
  =cut
  
  sub tmpdir {
      my $cached = $_[0]->_cached_tmpdir('TMPDIR');
      return $cached if defined $cached;
      $_[0]->_cache_tmpdir($_[0]->_tmpdir( $ENV{TMPDIR} ), 'TMPDIR');
  }
  
  =item updir
  
  Returns a string representing the parent directory. On Mac OS, this is "::".
  
  =cut
  
  sub updir {
      return "::";
  }
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as argument a path and returns true, if it is an absolute path.
  If the path has a leading ":", it's a relative path. Otherwise, it's an
  absolute path, unless the path doesn't contain any colons, i.e. it's a name
  like "a". In this particular case, the path is considered to be relative
  (i.e. it is considered to be a filename). Use ":" in the appropriate place
  in the path if you want to distinguish unambiguously. As a special case,
  the filename '' is always considered to be absolute. Note that with version
  1.2 of File::Spec::Mac, this does no longer consult the local filesystem.
  
  E.g.
  
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("a");         # false (relative)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute(":a:b:");     # false (relative)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("MacintoshHD:");
                                                      # true (absolute)
      File::Spec->file_name_is_absolute("");          # true (absolute)
  
  
  =cut
  
  sub file_name_is_absolute {
      my ($self,$file) = @_;

  	return (! ($file =~ m/^:/s) );
      } elsif ( $file eq '' ) {

      } else {
  	return 0; # i.e. a file like "a"
      }
  }
  
  =item path
  
  Returns the null list for the MacPerl application, since the concept is
  usually meaningless under Mac OS. But if you're using the MacPerl tool under
  MPW, it gives back $ENV{Commands} suitably split, as is done in
  :lib:ExtUtils:MM_Mac.pm.
  
  =cut
  
  sub path {
  #
  #  The concept is meaningless under the MacPerl application.
  #  Under MPW, it has a meaning.
  #
      return unless exists $ENV{Commands};
      return split(/,/, $ENV{Commands});
  }
  
  =item splitpath
  
      ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
      ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path,
                                                            $no_file );
  
  Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions.
  
  On Mac OS, assumes that the last part of the path is a filename unless
  $no_file is true or a trailing separator ":" is present.
  
  The volume portion is always returned with a trailing ":". The directory portion
  is always returned with a leading (to denote a relative path) and a trailing ":"
  (to denote a directory). The file portion is always returned I<without> a leading ":".
  Empty portions are returned as empty string ''.
  
  The results can be passed to C<catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.

      }
      $file = '' unless defined($file);
  
      return ($volume,$directory,$file);
  }
  
  
  =item splitdir
  
  The opposite of C<catdir()>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  $directories should be only the directory portion of the path on systems
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories. Consider using C<splitpath()> otherwise.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty directory names
  (C<"">) can be returned. Since C<catdir()> on Mac OS always appends a trailing
  colon to distinguish a directory path from a file path, a single trailing colon
  will be ignored, i.e. there's no empty directory name after it.
  
  Hence, on Mac OS, both
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c:" );    and
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c" );
  
  yield:
  
      ( "a", "b", "::", "c")
  
  while
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( ":a:b::c::" );
  
  yields:
  
      ( "a", "b", "::", "c", "::")

  =item catpath
  
      $path = File::Spec->catpath($volume,$directory,$file);
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. On Mac OS,
  $volume, $directory and $file are concatenated.  A ':' is inserted if need be. You
  may pass an empty string for each portion. If all portions are empty, the empty
  string is returned. If $volume is empty, the result will be a relative path,
  beginning with a ':'. If $volume and $directory are empty, a leading ":" (if any)
  is removed form $file and the remainder is returned. If $file is empty, the
  resulting path will have a trailing ':'.

  =item abs2rel
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path and returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  Note that both paths are assumed to have a notation that distinguishes a
  directory path (with trailing ':') from a file path (without trailing ':').
  
  If $base is not present or '', then the current working directory is used.
  If $base is relative, then it is converted to absolute form using C<rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to the current working directory.
  
  If $path and $base appear to be on two different volumes, we will not
  attempt to resolve the two paths, and we will instead simply return
  $path.  Note that previous versions of this module ignored the volume
  of $base, which resulted in garbage results part of the time.
  
  If $base doesn't have a trailing colon, the last element of $base is
  assumed to be a filename.  This filename is ignored.  Otherwise all path
  components are assumed to be directories.
  
  If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using C<rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to the current working directory.

  Note that both paths are assumed to have a notation that distinguishes a

  If $base is not present or '', then $base is set to the current working
  directory. If $base is relative, then it is converted to absolute form
  using C<rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to the
  current working directory.
  
  If $base doesn't have a trailing colon, the last element of $base is
  assumed to be a filename.  This filename is ignored.  Otherwise all path

  =item canonpath()
  
  No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
  path. On UNIX eliminates successive slashes and successive "/.".
  
      $cpath = File::Spec->canonpath( $path ) ;
  
  Note that this does *not* collapse F<x/../y> sections into F<y>.  This
  is by design.  If F</foo> on your system is a symlink to F</bar/baz>,
  then F</foo/../quux> is actually F</bar/quux>, not F</quux> as a naive
  F<../>-removal would give you.  If you want to do this kind of
  processing, you probably want C<Cwd>'s C<realpath()> function to
  actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.

  Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending

  string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and confuses
  OS2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the
  trailing slash :-)

  use constant _fn_case_tolerant => 0;
  
  =item file_name_is_absolute
  
  Takes as argument a path and returns true if it is an absolute path.
  
  This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2 or Mac 
  OS (Classic).  It does consult the working environment for VMS (see
  L<File::Spec::VMS/file_name_is_absolute>).
  
  =cut
  
  sub file_name_is_absolute {
      my ($self,$file) = @_;

  }
  
  =item path
  
  Takes no argument, returns the environment variable PATH as an array.
  
  =cut
  
  sub path {
      return () unless exists $ENV{PATH};
      my @path = split(':', $ENV{PATH});
      foreach (@path) { $_ = '.' if $_ eq '' }
      return @path;
  }
  
  =item join
  
  join is the same as catfile.
  
  =cut
  
  sub join {
      my $self = shift;
      return $self->catfile(@_);
  }
  
  =item splitpath

                                                            $no_file );
  
  Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions. On systems
  with no concept of volume, returns '' for volume. 
  
  For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, 
  assumes that the last file is a path unless $no_file is true or a 
  trailing separator or /. or /.. is present. On Unix this means that $no_file
  true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).
  
  The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.
  
  The results can be passed to L</catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.
  
  =cut
  
  sub splitpath {
      my ($self,$path, $nofile) = @_;
  
      my ($volume,$directory,$file) = ('','','');
  
      if ( $nofile ) {
          $directory = $path;
      }
      else {
          $path =~ m|^ ( (?: .* / (?: \.\.?\z )? )? ) ([^/]*) |xs;
          $directory = $1;
          $file      = $2;
      }
  
      return ($volume,$directory,$file);
  }
  
  
  =item splitdir
  
  The opposite of L</catdir()>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  $directories must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty
  directory names (C<''>) can be returned, because these are significant
  on some OSs.
  
  On Unix,
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( "/a/b//c/" );
  
  Yields:
  
      ( '', 'a', 'b', '', 'c', '' )
  
  =cut
  
  sub splitdir {
      return split m|/|, $_[1], -1;  # Preserve trailing fields
  }
  
  
  =item catpath()
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
  Unix, $volume is ignored, and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is
  inserted if needed (though if the directory portion doesn't start with
  '/' it is not added).  On other OSs, $volume is significant.
  
  =cut
  
  sub catpath {
      my ($self,$volume,$directory,$file) = @_;
  
      if ( $directory ne ''                && 
           $file ne ''                     && 
           substr( $directory, -1 ) ne '/' && 
           substr( $file, 0, 1 ) ne '/' 
      ) {
          $directory .= "/$file" ;
      }
      else {
          $directory .= $file ;
      }
  
      return $directory ;
  }
  
  =item abs2rel
  
  Takes a destination path and an optional base path returns a relative path
  from the base path to the destination path:
  
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
      $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If $base is not present or '', then L<cwd()|Cwd> is used. If $base is
  relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
  L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
  L<cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
  $base filename. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>.
  This means that it is taken to be relative to L<cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made, so the result may not be correct if
  C<$base> contains symbolic links.  (Apply
  L<Cwd::abs_path()|Cwd/abs_path> beforehand if that
  is a concern.)  On VMS, there is interaction with the working environment, as
  logicals and macros are expanded.

  Converts a relative path to an absolute path. 
  
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path ) ;
      $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;
  
  If $base is not present or '', then L<cwd()|Cwd> is used. If $base is
  relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
  L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
  L<cwd()|Cwd>.
  
  On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores
  the $base filename. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
  directories.
  
  If $path is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using L</canonpath()>.
  
  No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
  interaction with the working environment, as logicals and
  macros are expanded.

  File::Spec::VMS - methods for VMS file specs
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   require File::Spec::VMS; # Done internally by File::Spec if needed
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  See File::Spec::Unix for a documentation of the methods provided
  there. This package overrides the implementation of these methods, not
  the semantics.
  
  The default behavior is to allow either VMS or Unix syntax on input and to 
  return VMS syntax on output unless Unix syntax has been explicitly requested
  via the C<DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT> CRTL feature.

      SYS:/temp
      C:\system\temp

  The SYS:/temp is preferred in Novell NetWare and the C:\system\temp
  for Symbian (the File::Spec::Win32 is used also for those platforms).

  =item canonpath
  
  No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
  path. On UNIX eliminated successive slashes and successive "/.".
  On Win32 makes 
  
  	dir1\dir2\dir3\..\..\dir4 -> \dir\dir4 and even
  	dir1\dir2\dir3\...\dir4   -> \dir\dir4

  Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions. Assumes that 
  the last file is a path unless the path ends in '\\', '\\.', '\\..'
  or $no_file is true.  On Win32 this means that $no_file true makes this return 
  ( $volume, $path, '' ).
  
  Separators accepted are \ and /.
  
  Volumes can be drive letters or UNC sharenames (\\server\share).
  
  The results can be passed to L</catpath> to get back a path equivalent to
  (usually identical to) the original path.

  =item splitdir
  
  The opposite of L<catdir()|File::Spec/catdir>.
  
      @dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );
  
  $directories must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
  that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
  files from directories.
  
  Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, leading empty and 
  trailing directory entries can be returned, because these are significant
  on some OSs. So,
  
      File::Spec->splitdir( "/a/b/c" );
  
  Yields:
  
      ( '', 'a', 'b', '', 'c', '' )
  
  =cut
  
  sub splitdir {
      my ($self,$directories) = @_ ;
      #
      # split() likes to forget about trailing null fields, so here we
      # check to be sure that there will not be any before handling the
      # simple case.
      #
      if ( $directories !~ m|[\\/]\Z(?!\n)| ) {
          return split( m|[\\/]|, $directories );
      }
      else {
          #
          # since there was a trailing separator, add a file name to the end, 
          # then do the split, then replace it with ''.
          #
          my( @directories )= split( m|[\\/]|, "${directories}dummy" ) ;
          $directories[ $#directories ]= '' ;
          return @directories ;
      }
  }
  
  
  =item catpath
  
  Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
  Unix, $volume is ignored, and this is just like catfile(). On other OSs,
  the $volume become significant.

      $volume .= $v
          if ( (($v) = $volume =~ m@^([\\/])[\\/][^\\/]+[\\/][^\\/]+\Z(?!\n)@s) &&
               $directory =~ m@^[^\\/]@s
             ) ;

  JSON::XS - JSON serialising/deserialising, done correctly and fast
  
  =encoding utf-8
  
  JSON::XS - 正しくて高速な JSON シリアライザ/デシリアライザ
             (http://fleur.hio.jp/perldoc/mix/lib/JSON/XS.html)
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
   use JSON::XS;
  
   # exported functions, they croak on error
   # and expect/generate UTF-8
  
   $utf8_encoded_json_text = encode_json $perl_hash_or_arrayref;
   $perl_hash_or_arrayref  = decode_json $utf8_encoded_json_text;
  
   # OO-interface
  
   $coder = JSON::XS->new->ascii->pretty->allow_nonref;
   $pretty_printed_unencoded = $coder->encode ($perl_scalar);
   $perl_scalar = $coder->decode ($unicode_json_text);
  
   # Note that JSON version 2.0 and above will automatically use JSON::XS
   # if available, at virtually no speed overhead either, so you should
   # be able to just:
   
   use JSON;
  
   # and do the same things, except that you have a pure-perl fallback now.
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module converts Perl data structures to JSON and vice versa. Its
  primary goal is to be I<correct> and its secondary goal is to be
  I<fast>. To reach the latter goal it was written in C.
  
  Beginning with version 2.0 of the JSON module, when both JSON and
  JSON::XS are installed, then JSON will fall back on JSON::XS (this can be
  overridden) with no overhead due to emulation (by inheriting constructor
  and methods). If JSON::XS is not available, it will fall back to the
  compatible JSON::PP module as backend, so using JSON instead of JSON::XS
  gives you a portable JSON API that can be fast when you need and doesn't
  require a C compiler when that is a problem.
  
  As this is the n-th-something JSON module on CPAN, what was the reason
  to write yet another JSON module? While it seems there are many JSON
  modules, none of them correctly handle all corner cases, and in most cases
  their maintainers are unresponsive, gone missing, or not listening to bug
  reports for other reasons.
  
  See MAPPING, below, on how JSON::XS maps perl values to JSON values and
  vice versa.
  
  =head2 FEATURES
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * correct Unicode handling
  
  This module knows how to handle Unicode, documents how and when it does
  so, and even documents what "correct" means.
  
  =item * round-trip integrity
  
  When you serialise a perl data structure using only data types supported
  by JSON and Perl, the deserialised data structure is identical on the Perl
  level. (e.g. the string "2.0" doesn't suddenly become "2" just because
  it looks like a number). There I<are> minor exceptions to this, read the
  MAPPING section below to learn about those.
  
  =item * strict checking of JSON correctness
  
  There is no guessing, no generating of illegal JSON texts by default,
  and only JSON is accepted as input by default (the latter is a security
  feature).
  
  =item * fast
  
  Compared to other JSON modules and other serialisers such as Storable,
  this module usually compares favourably in terms of speed, too.
  
  =item * simple to use
  
  This module has both a simple functional interface as well as an object
  oriented interface.
  
  =item * reasonably versatile output formats
  
  You can choose between the most compact guaranteed-single-line format
  possible (nice for simple line-based protocols), a pure-ASCII format
  (for when your transport is not 8-bit clean, still supports the whole
  Unicode range), or a pretty-printed format (for when you want to read that
  stuff). Or you can combine those features in whatever way you like.

  =head1 FUNCTIONAL INTERFACE
  
  The following convenience methods are provided by this module. They are
  exported by default:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $json_text = encode_json $perl_scalar
  
  Converts the given Perl data structure to a UTF-8 encoded, binary string
  (that is, the string contains octets only). Croaks on error.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
     $json_text = JSON::XS->new->utf8->encode ($perl_scalar)
  
  Except being faster.
  
  =item $perl_scalar = decode_json $json_text
  
  The opposite of C<encode_json>: expects an UTF-8 (binary) string and tries
  to parse that as an UTF-8 encoded JSON text, returning the resulting
  reference. Croaks on error.
  
  This function call is functionally identical to:
  
     $perl_scalar = JSON::XS->new->utf8->decode ($json_text)
  
  Except being faster.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head1 A FEW NOTES ON UNICODE AND PERL
  
  Since this often leads to confusion, here are a few very clear words on
  how Unicode works in Perl, modulo bugs.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item 1. Perl strings can store characters with ordinal values > 255.
  
  This enables you to store Unicode characters as single characters in a
  Perl string - very natural.
  
  =item 2. Perl does I<not> associate an encoding with your strings.
  
  ... until you force it to, e.g. when matching it against a regex, or
  printing the scalar to a file, in which case Perl either interprets your
  string as locale-encoded text, octets/binary, or as Unicode, depending
  on various settings. In no case is an encoding stored together with your
  data, it is I<use> that decides encoding, not any magical meta data.
  
  =item 3. The internal utf-8 flag has no meaning with regards to the
  encoding of your string.
  
  Just ignore that flag unless you debug a Perl bug, a module written in
  XS or want to dive into the internals of perl. Otherwise it will only
  confuse you, as, despite the name, it says nothing about how your string
  is encoded. You can have Unicode strings with that flag set, with that
  flag clear, and you can have binary data with that flag set and that flag
  clear. Other possibilities exist, too.
  
  If you didn't know about that flag, just the better, pretend it doesn't
  exist.
  
  =item 4. A "Unicode String" is simply a string where each character can be
  validly interpreted as a Unicode code point.
  
  If you have UTF-8 encoded data, it is no longer a Unicode string, but a
  Unicode string encoded in UTF-8, giving you a binary string.
  
  =item 5. A string containing "high" (> 255) character values is I<not> a UTF-8 string.
  
  It's a fact. Learn to live with it.
  
  =back
  
  I hope this helps :)
  
  
  =head1 OBJECT-ORIENTED INTERFACE
  
  The object oriented interface lets you configure your own encoding or
  decoding style, within the limits of supported formats.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item $json = new JSON::XS
  
  Creates a new JSON::XS object that can be used to de/encode JSON
  strings. All boolean flags described below are by default I<disabled>.
  
  The mutators for flags all return the JSON object again and thus calls can
  be chained:
  
     my $json = JSON::XS->new->utf8->space_after->encode ({a => [1,2]})
     => {"a": [1, 2]}
  
  =item $json = $json->ascii ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_ascii
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  generate characters outside the code range C<0..127> (which is ASCII). Any
  Unicode characters outside that range will be escaped using either a
  single \uXXXX (BMP characters) or a double \uHHHH\uLLLLL escape sequence,
  as per RFC4627. The resulting encoded JSON text can be treated as a native
  Unicode string, an ascii-encoded, latin1-encoded or UTF-8 encoded string,
  or any other superset of ASCII.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not escape Unicode
  characters unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags. This results
  in a faster and more compact format.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this
  document.
  
  The main use for this flag is to produce JSON texts that can be
  transmitted over a 7-bit channel, as the encoded JSON texts will not
  contain any 8 bit characters.
  
    JSON::XS->new->ascii (1)->encode ([chr 0x10401])
    => ["\ud801\udc01"]
  
  =item $json = $json->latin1 ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_latin1
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will encode
  the resulting JSON text as latin1 (or iso-8859-1), escaping any characters
  outside the code range C<0..255>. The resulting string can be treated as a
  latin1-encoded JSON text or a native Unicode string. The C<decode> method
  will not be affected in any way by this flag, as C<decode> by default
  expects Unicode, which is a strict superset of latin1.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not escape Unicode
  characters unless required by the JSON syntax or other flags.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this
  document.
  
  The main use for this flag is efficiently encoding binary data as JSON
  text, as most octets will not be escaped, resulting in a smaller encoded
  size. The disadvantage is that the resulting JSON text is encoded
  in latin1 (and must correctly be treated as such when storing and
  transferring), a rare encoding for JSON. It is therefore most useful when
  you want to store data structures known to contain binary data efficiently
  in files or databases, not when talking to other JSON encoders/decoders.
  
    JSON::XS->new->latin1->encode (["\x{89}\x{abc}"]
    => ["\x{89}\\u0abc"]    # (perl syntax, U+abc escaped, U+89 not)
  
  =item $json = $json->utf8 ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_utf8
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will encode
  the JSON result into UTF-8, as required by many protocols, while the
  C<decode> method expects to be handled an UTF-8-encoded string.  Please
  note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain any characters outside the
  range C<0..255>, they are thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O. In future
  versions, enabling this option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16
  and UTF-32 encoding families, as described in RFC4627.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will return the JSON
  string as a (non-encoded) Unicode string, while C<decode> expects thus a
  Unicode string.  Any decoding or encoding (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs
  to be done yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.
  
  See also the section I<ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES> later in this
  document.
  
  Example, output UTF-16BE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $jsontext = encode "UTF-16BE", JSON::XS->new->encode ($object);
  
  Example, decode UTF-32LE-encoded JSON:
  
    use Encode;
    $object = JSON::XS->new->decode (decode "UTF-32LE", $jsontext);
  
  =item $json = $json->pretty ([$enable])
  
  This enables (or disables) all of the C<indent>, C<space_before> and
  C<space_after> (and in the future possibly more) flags in one call to
  generate the most readable (or most compact) form possible.
  
  Example, pretty-print some simple structure:
  
     my $json = JSON::XS->new->pretty(1)->encode ({a => [1,2]})
     =>
     {
        "a" : [
           1,
           2
        ]
     }
  
  =item $json = $json->indent ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_indent
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will use a multiline
  format as output, putting every array member or object/hash key-value pair
  into its own line, indenting them properly.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, no newlines or indenting will be produced, and the
  resulting JSON text is guaranteed not to contain any C<newlines>.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  =item $json = $json->space_before ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_space_before
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space before the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts. You will also
  most likely combine this setting with C<space_after>.
  
  Example, space_before enabled, space_after and indent disabled:
  
     {"key" :"value"}
  
  =item $json = $json->space_after ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_space_after
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will add an extra
  optional space after the C<:> separating keys from values in JSON objects
  and extra whitespace after the C<,> separating key-value pairs and array
  members.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will not add any extra
  space at those places.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  Example, space_before and indent disabled, space_after enabled:
  
     {"key": "value"}
  
  =item $json = $json->relaxed ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_relaxed
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<decode> will accept some
  extensions to normal JSON syntax (see below). C<encode> will not be
  affected in anyway. I<Be aware that this option makes you accept invalid
  JSON texts as if they were valid!>. I suggest only to use this option to
  parse application-specific files written by humans (configuration files,
  resource files etc.)
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<decode> will only accept
  valid JSON texts.
  
  Currently accepted extensions are:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item * list items can have an end-comma
  
  JSON I<separates> array elements and key-value pairs with commas. This
  can be annoying if you write JSON texts manually and want to be able to
  quickly append elements, so this extension accepts comma at the end of
  such items not just between them:
  
     [
        1,
        2, <- this comma not normally allowed
     ]
     {
        "k1": "v1",
        "k2": "v2", <- this comma not normally allowed
     }
  
  =item * shell-style '#'-comments
  
  Whenever JSON allows whitespace, shell-style comments are additionally
  allowed. They are terminated by the first carriage-return or line-feed
  character, after which more white-space and comments are allowed.
  
    [
       1, # this comment not allowed in JSON
          # neither this one...
    ]
  
  =back
  
  =item $json = $json->canonical ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_canonical
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will output JSON objects
  by sorting their keys. This is adding a comparatively high overhead.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will output key-value
  pairs in the order Perl stores them (which will likely change between runs
  of the same script, and can change even within the same run from 5.18
  onwards).
  
  This option is useful if you want the same data structure to be encoded as
  the same JSON text (given the same overall settings). If it is disabled,
  the same hash might be encoded differently even if contains the same data,
  as key-value pairs have no inherent ordering in Perl.
  
  This setting has no effect when decoding JSON texts.
  
  This setting has currently no effect on tied hashes.
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_nonref ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_allow_nonref
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method can convert a
  non-reference into its corresponding string, number or null JSON value,
  which is an extension to RFC4627. Likewise, C<decode> will accept those JSON
  values instead of croaking.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the C<encode> method will croak if it isn't
  passed an arrayref or hashref, as JSON texts must either be an object
  or array. Likewise, C<decode> will croak if given something that is not a
  JSON object or array.
  
  Example, encode a Perl scalar as JSON value with enabled C<allow_nonref>,
  resulting in an invalid JSON text:
  
     JSON::XS->new->allow_nonref->encode ("Hello, World!")
     => "Hello, World!"
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_unknown ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_allow_unknown
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode> will I<not> throw an
  exception when it encounters values it cannot represent in JSON (for
  example, filehandles) but instead will encode a JSON C<null> value. Note
  that blessed objects are not included here and are handled separately by
  c<allow_nonref>.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters anything it cannot encode as JSON.
  
  This option does not affect C<decode> in any way, and it is recommended to
  leave it off unless you know your communications partner.
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_blessed ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_allow_blessed
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then the C<encode> method will not
  barf when it encounters a blessed reference that it cannot convert
  otherwise. Instead, a JSON C<null> value is encoded instead of the object.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will throw an
  exception when it encounters a blessed object that it cannot convert
  otherwise.
  
  This setting has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  =item $json = $json->convert_blessed ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_convert_blessed
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<TO_JSON> method
  on the object's class. If found, it will be called in scalar context and
  the resulting scalar will be encoded instead of the object.
  
  The C<TO_JSON> method may safely call die if it wants. If C<TO_JSON>
  returns other blessed objects, those will be handled in the same
  way. C<TO_JSON> must take care of not causing an endless recursion cycle
  (== crash) in this case. The name of C<TO_JSON> was chosen because other
  methods called by the Perl core (== not by the user of the object) are
  usually in upper case letters and to avoid collisions with any C<to_json>
  function or method.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will not consider
  this type of conversion.
  
  This setting has no effect on C<decode>.
  
  =item $json = $json->allow_tags ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->allow_tags
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION> for details.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), then C<encode>, upon encountering a
  blessed object, will check for the availability of the C<FREEZE> method on
  the object's class. If found, it will be used to serialise the object into
  a nonstandard tagged JSON value (that JSON decoders cannot decode).
  
  It also causes C<decode> to parse such tagged JSON values and deserialise
  them via a call to the C<THAW> method.
  
  If C<$enable> is false (the default), then C<encode> will not consider
  this type of conversion, and tagged JSON values will cause a parse error
  in C<decode>, as if tags were not part of the grammar.
  
  =item $json = $json->filter_json_object ([$coderef->($hashref)])
  
  When C<$coderef> is specified, it will be called from C<decode> each
  time it decodes a JSON object. The only argument is a reference to the
  newly-created hash. If the code references returns a single scalar (which
  need not be a reference), this value (i.e. a copy of that scalar to avoid
  aliasing) is inserted into the deserialised data structure. If it returns
  an empty list (NOTE: I<not> C<undef>, which is a valid scalar), the
  original deserialised hash will be inserted. This setting can slow down
  decoding considerably.
  
  When C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, any existing callback will
  be removed and C<decode> will not change the deserialised hash in any
  way.
  
  Example, convert all JSON objects into the integer 5:
  
     my $js = JSON::XS->new->filter_json_object (sub { 5 });
     # returns [5]
     $js->decode ('[{}]')
     # throw an exception because allow_nonref is not enabled
     # so a lone 5 is not allowed.
     $js->decode ('{"a":1, "b":2}');
  
  =item $json = $json->filter_json_single_key_object ($key [=> $coderef->($value)])
  
  Works remotely similar to C<filter_json_object>, but is only called for
  JSON objects having a single key named C<$key>.
  
  This C<$coderef> is called before the one specified via
  C<filter_json_object>, if any. It gets passed the single value in the JSON
  object. If it returns a single value, it will be inserted into the data
  structure. If it returns nothing (not even C<undef> but the empty list),
  the callback from C<filter_json_object> will be called next, as if no
  single-key callback were specified.
  
  If C<$coderef> is omitted or undefined, the corresponding callback will be
  disabled. There can only ever be one callback for a given key.
  
  As this callback gets called less often then the C<filter_json_object>
  one, decoding speed will not usually suffer as much. Therefore, single-key
  objects make excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially
  as single-key JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept
  as JSON gets (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not
  support this in any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks
  like a serialised Perl hash.
  
  Typical names for the single object key are C<__class_whatever__>, or
  C<$__dollars_are_rarely_used__$> or C<}ugly_brace_placement>, or even
  things like C<__class_md5sum(classname)__>, to reduce the risk of clashing
  with real hashes.
  
  Example, decode JSON objects of the form C<< { "__widget__" => <id> } >>
  into the corresponding C<< $WIDGET{<id>} >> object:
  
     # return whatever is in $WIDGET{5}:
     JSON::XS
        ->new
        ->filter_json_single_key_object (__widget__ => sub {
              $WIDGET{ $_[0] }
           })
        ->decode ('{"__widget__": 5')
  
     # this can be used with a TO_JSON method in some "widget" class
     # for serialisation to json:
     sub WidgetBase::TO_JSON {
        my ($self) = @_;
  
        unless ($self->{id}) {
           $self->{id} = ..get..some..id..;
           $WIDGET{$self->{id}} = $self;
        }
  
        { __widget__ => $self->{id} }
     }
  
  =item $json = $json->shrink ([$enable])
  
  =item $enabled = $json->get_shrink
  
  Perl usually over-allocates memory a bit when allocating space for
  strings. This flag optionally resizes strings generated by either
  C<encode> or C<decode> to their minimum size possible. This can save
  memory when your JSON texts are either very very long or you have many
  short strings. It will also try to downgrade any strings to octet-form
  if possible: perl stores strings internally either in an encoding called
  UTF-X or in octet-form. The latter cannot store everything but uses less
  space in general (and some buggy Perl or C code might even rely on that
  internal representation being used).
  
  The actual definition of what shrink does might change in future versions,
  but it will always try to save space at the expense of time.
  
  If C<$enable> is true (or missing), the string returned by C<encode> will
  be shrunk-to-fit, while all strings generated by C<decode> will also be
  shrunk-to-fit.
  
  If C<$enable> is false, then the normal perl allocation algorithms are used.
  If you work with your data, then this is likely to be faster.
  
  In the future, this setting might control other things, such as converting
  strings that look like integers or floats into integers or floats
  internally (there is no difference on the Perl level), saving space.
  
  =item $json = $json->max_depth ([$maximum_nesting_depth])
  
  =item $max_depth = $json->get_max_depth
  
  Sets the maximum nesting level (default C<512>) accepted while encoding
  or decoding. If a higher nesting level is detected in JSON text or a Perl
  data structure, then the encoder and decoder will stop and croak at that
  point.
  
  Nesting level is defined by number of hash- or arrayrefs that the encoder
  needs to traverse to reach a given point or the number of C<{> or C<[>
  characters without their matching closing parenthesis crossed to reach a
  given character in a string.
  
  Setting the maximum depth to one disallows any nesting, so that ensures
  that the object is only a single hash/object or array.
  
  If no argument is given, the highest possible setting will be used, which
  is rarely useful.
  
  Note that nesting is implemented by recursion in C. The default value has
  been chosen to be as large as typical operating systems allow without
  crashing.
  
  See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, below, for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =item $json = $json->max_size ([$maximum_string_size])
  
  =item $max_size = $json->get_max_size
  
  Set the maximum length a JSON text may have (in bytes) where decoding is
  being attempted. The default is C<0>, meaning no limit. When C<decode>
  is called on a string that is longer then this many bytes, it will not
  attempt to decode the string but throw an exception. This setting has no
  effect on C<encode> (yet).
  
  If no argument is given, the limit check will be deactivated (same as when
  C<0> is specified).
  
  See SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS, below, for more info on why this is useful.
  
  =item $json_text = $json->encode ($perl_scalar)
  
  Converts the given Perl value or data structure to its JSON
  representation. Croaks on error.
  
  =item $perl_scalar = $json->decode ($json_text)
  
  The opposite of C<encode>: expects a JSON text and tries to parse it,
  returning the resulting simple scalar or reference. Croaks on error.
  
  =item ($perl_scalar, $characters) = $json->decode_prefix ($json_text)
  
  This works like the C<decode> method, but instead of raising an exception
  when there is trailing garbage after the first JSON object, it will
  silently stop parsing there and return the number of characters consumed
  so far.
  
  This is useful if your JSON texts are not delimited by an outer protocol
  and you need to know where the JSON text ends.

     => ([], 3)

  =head1 INCREMENTAL PARSING
  
  In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON
  texts. While this module always has to keep both JSON text and resulting
  Perl data structure in memory at one time, it does allow you to parse a
  JSON stream incrementally. It does so by accumulating text until it has
  a full JSON object, which it then can decode. This process is similar to
  using C<decode_prefix> to see if a full JSON object is available, but
  is much more efficient (and can be implemented with a minimum of method
  calls).
  
  JSON::XS will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure it
  has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but
  truly incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as
  early as the full parser, for example, it doesn't detect mismatched
  parentheses. The only thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as
  soon as a syntactically valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need
  to set resource limits (e.g. C<max_size>) to ensure the parser will stop
  parsing in the presence if syntax errors.
  
  The following methods implement this incremental parser.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item [void, scalar or list context] = $json->incr_parse ([$string])
  
  This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text and
  extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
  functions are optional).
  
  If C<$string> is given, then this string is appended to the already
  existing JSON fragment stored in the C<$json> object.
  
  After that, if the function is called in void context, it will simply
  return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more text
  in as many chunks as you want.
  
  If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to extract
  exactly I<one> JSON object. If that is successful, it will return this
  object, otherwise it will return C<undef>. If there is a parse error,
  this method will croak just as C<decode> would do (one can then use
  C<incr_skip> to skip the erroneous part). This is the most common way of
  using the method.
  
  And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many objects
  from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
  otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators between the JSON
  objects or arrays, instead they must be concatenated back-to-back. If
  an error occurs, an exception will be raised as in the scalar context
  case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed JSON texts will be
  lost.
  
  Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and return
  them.
  
     my @objs = JSON::XS->new->incr_parse ("[5][7][1,2]");
  
  =item $lvalue_string = $json->incr_text
  
  This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an lvalue, that
  is, you can manipulate it. This I<only> works when a preceding call to
  C<incr_parse> in I<scalar context> successfully returned an object. Under
  all other circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it.
  although in simple tests it might actually work, it I<will> fail under
  real world conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this
  method before having parsed anything.
  
  This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text after a
  JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by non-JSON text
  (such as commas).
  
  =item $json->incr_skip
  
  This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will remove
  the parsed text from the input buffer so far. This is useful after
  C<incr_parse> died, in which case the input buffer and incremental parser
  state is left unchanged, to skip the text parsed so far and to reset the
  parse state.
  
  The difference to C<incr_reset> is that only text until the parse error
  occurred is removed.
  
  =item $json->incr_reset
  
  This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this call,
  it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.
  
  This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and want to
  ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser after
  each successful decode.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 LIMITATIONS
  
  All options that affect decoding are supported, except
  C<allow_nonref>. The reason for this is that it cannot be made to work
  sensibly: JSON objects and arrays are self-delimited, i.e. you can
  concatenate them back to back and still decode them perfectly. This does
  not hold true for JSON numbers, however.
  
  For example, is the string C<1> a single JSON number, or is it simply the
  start of C<12>? Or is C<12> a single JSON number, or the concatenation
  of C<1> and C<2>? In neither case you can tell, and this is why JSON::XS
  takes the conservative route and disallows this case.
  
  =head2 EXAMPLES
  
  Some examples will make all this clearer. First, a simple example that
  works similarly to C<decode_prefix>: We want to decode the JSON object at
  the start of a string and identify the portion after the JSON object:
  
     my $text = "[1,2,3] hello";
  
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     my $obj = $json->incr_parse ($text)
        or die "expected JSON object or array at beginning of string";
  
     my $tail = $json->incr_text;
     # $tail now contains " hello"
  
  Easy, isn't it?
  
  Now for a more complicated example: Imagine a hypothetical protocol where
  you read some requests from a TCP stream, and each request is a JSON
  array, without any separation between them (in fact, it is often useful to
  use newlines as "separators", as these get interpreted as whitespace at
  the start of the JSON text, which makes it possible to test said protocol
  with C<telnet>...).
  
  Here is how you'd do it (it is trivial to write this in an event-based
  manner):
  
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     # read some data from the socket
     while (sysread $socket, my $buf, 4096) {
  
        # split and decode as many requests as possible
        for my $request ($json->incr_parse ($buf)) {
           # act on the $request
        }
     }
  
  Another complicated example: Assume you have a string with JSON objects
  or arrays, all separated by (optional) comma characters (e.g. C<[1],[2],
  [3]>). To parse them, we have to skip the commas between the JSON texts,
  and here is where the lvalue-ness of C<incr_text> comes in useful:
  
     my $text = "[1],[2], [3]";
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     # void context, so no parsing done
     $json->incr_parse ($text);
  
     # now extract as many objects as possible. note the
     # use of scalar context so incr_text can be called.
     while (my $obj = $json->incr_parse) {
        # do something with $obj
  
        # now skip the optional comma
        $json->incr_text =~ s/^ \s* , //x;
     }
  
  Now lets go for a very complex example: Assume that you have a gigantic
  JSON array-of-objects, many gigabytes in size, and you want to parse it,
  but you cannot load it into memory fully (this has actually happened in
  the real world :).
  
  Well, you lost, you have to implement your own JSON parser. But JSON::XS
  can still help you: You implement a (very simple) array parser and let
  JSON decode the array elements, which are all full JSON objects on their
  own (this wouldn't work if the array elements could be JSON numbers, for
  example):
  
     my $json = new JSON::XS;
  
     # open the monster
     open my $fh, "<bigfile.json"
        or die "bigfile: $!";
  
     # first parse the initial "["
     for (;;) {
        sysread $fh, my $buf, 65536
           or die "read error: $!";
        $json->incr_parse ($buf); # void context, so no parsing
  
        # Exit the loop once we found and removed(!) the initial "[".
        # In essence, we are (ab-)using the $json object as a simple scalar
        # we append data to.
        last if $json->incr_text =~ s/^ \s* \[ //x;
     }
  
     # now we have the skipped the initial "[", so continue
     # parsing all the elements.
     for (;;) {
        # in this loop we read data until we got a single JSON object
        for (;;) {
           if (my $obj = $json->incr_parse) {
              # do something with $obj
              last;
           }
  
           # add more data
           sysread $fh, my $buf, 65536
              or die "read error: $!";
           $json->incr_parse ($buf); # void context, so no parsing
        }
  
        # in this loop we read data until we either found and parsed the
        # separating "," between elements, or the final "]"
        for (;;) {
           # first skip whitespace
           $json->incr_text =~ s/^\s*//;
  
           # if we find "]", we are done
           if ($json->incr_text =~ s/^\]//) {
              print "finished.\n";
              exit;
           }
  
           # if we find ",", we can continue with the next element
           if ($json->incr_text =~ s/^,//) {
              last;
           }
  
           # if we find anything else, we have a parse error!
           if (length $json->incr_text) {
              die "parse error near ", $json->incr_text;
           }
  
           # else add more data
           sysread $fh, my $buf, 65536
              or die "read error: $!";
           $json->incr_parse ($buf); # void context, so no parsing
        }
  
  This is a complex example, but most of the complexity comes from the fact
  that we are trying to be correct (bear with me if I am wrong, I never ran
  the above example :).
  
  
  
  =head1 MAPPING
  
  This section describes how JSON::XS maps Perl values to JSON values and
  vice versa. These mappings are designed to "do the right thing" in most
  circumstances automatically, preserving round-tripping characteristics
  (what you put in comes out as something equivalent).
  
  For the more enlightened: note that in the following descriptions,
  lowercase I<perl> refers to the Perl interpreter, while uppercase I<Perl>
  refers to the abstract Perl language itself.
  
  
  =head2 JSON -> PERL
  
  =over 4
  
  =item object
  
  A JSON object becomes a reference to a hash in Perl. No ordering of object
  keys is preserved (JSON does not preserve object key ordering itself).
  
  =item array
  
  A JSON array becomes a reference to an array in Perl.
  
  =item string
  
  A JSON string becomes a string scalar in Perl - Unicode codepoints in JSON
  are represented by the same codepoints in the Perl string, so no manual
  decoding is necessary.
  
  =item number
  
  A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
  string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
  the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
  the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
  might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
  
  If the number consists of digits only, JSON::XS will try to represent
  it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to represent it as
  a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible without loss of
  precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a string value (in
  which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON number will be
  re-encoded to a JSON string).
  
  Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will always be
  represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a loss of
  precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping ability, but
  the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON number).
  
  Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point values cannot
  represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when converting from and to
  floating point, JSON::XS only guarantees precision up to but not including
  the least significant bit.
  
  =item true, false
  
  These JSON atoms become C<Types::Serialiser::true> and
  C<Types::Serialiser::false>, respectively. They are overloaded to act
  almost exactly like the numbers C<1> and C<0>. You can check whether
  a scalar is a JSON boolean by using the C<Types::Serialiser::is_bool>
  function (after C<use Types::Serialier>, of course).
  
  =item null
  
  A JSON null atom becomes C<undef> in Perl.
  
  =item shell-style comments (C<< # I<text> >>)
  
  As a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax that is enabled by the
  C<relaxed> setting, shell-style comments are allowed. They can start
  anywhere outside strings and go till the end of the line.
  
  =item tagged values (C<< (I<tag>)I<value> >>).
  
  Another nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax, enabled with the
  C<allow_tags> setting, are tagged values. In this implementation, the
  I<tag> must be a perl package/class name encoded as a JSON string, and the
  I<value> must be a JSON array encoding optional constructor arguments.
  
  See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION>, below, for details.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 PERL -> JSON
  
  The mapping from Perl to JSON is slightly more difficult, as Perl is a
  truly typeless language, so we can only guess which JSON type is meant by
  a Perl value.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item hash references
  
  Perl hash references become JSON objects. As there is no inherent
  ordering in hash keys (or JSON objects), they will usually be encoded
  in a pseudo-random order. JSON::XS can optionally sort the hash keys
  (determined by the I<canonical> flag), so the same datastructure will
  serialise to the same JSON text (given same settings and version of
  JSON::XS), but this incurs a runtime overhead and is only rarely useful,
  e.g. when you want to compare some JSON text against another for equality.
  
  =item array references
  
  Perl array references become JSON arrays.
  
  =item other references
  
  Other unblessed references are generally not allowed and will cause an
  exception to be thrown, except for references to the integers C<0> and
  C<1>, which get turned into C<false> and C<true> atoms in JSON.
  
  Since C<JSON::XS> uses the boolean model from L<Types::Serialiser>, you
  can also C<use Types::Serialiser> and then use C<Types::Serialiser::false>
  and C<Types::Serialiser::true> to improve readability.
  
     use Types::Serialiser;
     encode_json [\0, Types::Serialiser::true]      # yields [false,true]
  
  =item Types::Serialiser::true, Types::Serialiser::false
  
  These special values from the L<Types::Serialiser> module become JSON true
  and JSON false values, respectively. You can also use C<\1> and C<\0>
  directly if you want.
  
  =item blessed objects
  
  Blessed objects are not directly representable in JSON, but C<JSON::XS>
  allows various ways of handling objects. See L<OBJECT SERIALISATION>,
  below, for details.
  
  =item simple scalars
  
  Simple Perl scalars (any scalar that is not a reference) are the most
  difficult objects to encode: JSON::XS will encode undefined scalars as
  JSON C<null> values, scalars that have last been used in a string context
  before encoding as JSON strings, and anything else as number value:
  
     # dump as number
     encode_json [2]                      # yields [2]
     encode_json [-3.0e17]                # yields [-3e+17]
     my $value = 5; encode_json [$value]  # yields [5]
  
     # used as string, so dump as string
     print $value;
     encode_json [$value]                 # yields ["5"]
  
     # undef becomes null
     encode_json [undef]                  # yields [null]
  
  You can force the type to be a JSON string by stringifying it:
  
     my $x = 3.1; # some variable containing a number
     "$x";        # stringified
     $x .= "";    # another, more awkward way to stringify
     print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often
  
  You can force the type to be a JSON number by numifying it:
  
     my $x = "3"; # some variable containing a string
     $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
     $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
  
  You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure, ways. Tell me
  if you need this capability (but don't forget to explain why it's needed
  :).
  
  Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under Perl (so
  binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl, which
  can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might expose
  extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such as
  infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is an
  error to pass those in.
  
  =back
  
  =head2 OBJECT SERIALISATION
  
  As JSON cannot directly represent Perl objects, you have to choose between
  a pure JSON representation (without the ability to deserialise the object
  automatically again), and a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax,
  tagged values.
  
  =head3 SERIALISATION
  
  What happens when C<JSON::XS> encounters a Perl object depends on the
  C<allow_blessed>, C<convert_blessed> and C<allow_tags> settings, which are
  used in this order:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item 1. C<allow_tags> is enabled and the object has a C<FREEZE> method.
  
  In this case, C<JSON::XS> uses the L<Types::Serialiser> object
  serialisation protocol to create a tagged JSON value, using a nonstandard
  extension to the JSON syntax.
  
  This works by invoking the C<FREEZE> method on the object, with the first
  argument being the object to serialise, and the second argument being the
  constant string C<JSON> to distinguish it from other serialisers.
  
  The C<FREEZE> method can return any number of values (i.e. zero or
  more). These values and the paclkage/classname of the object will then be
  encoded as a tagged JSON value in the following format:
  
     ("classname")[FREEZE return values...]
  
  e.g.:
  
     ("URI")["http://www.google.com/"]
     ("MyDate")[2013,10,29]
     ("ImageData::JPEG")["Z3...VlCg=="]
  
  For example, the hypothetical C<My::Object> C<FREEZE> method might use the
  objects C<type> and C<id> members to encode the object:
  
     sub My::Object::FREEZE {
        my ($self, $serialiser) = @_;
  
        ($self->{type}, $self->{id})
     }
  
  =item 2. C<convert_blessed> is enabled and the object has a C<TO_JSON> method.
  
  In this case, the C<TO_JSON> method of the object is invoked in scalar
  context. It must return a single scalar that can be directly encoded into
  JSON. This scalar replaces the object in the JSON text.
  
  For example, the following C<TO_JSON> method will convert all L<URI>
  objects to JSON strings when serialised. The fatc that these values
  originally were L<URI> objects is lost.
  
     sub URI::TO_JSON {
        my ($uri) = @_;
        $uri->as_string
     }
  
  =item 3. C<allow_blessed> is enabled.
  
  The object will be serialised as a JSON null value.
  
  =item 4. none of the above
  
  If none of the settings are enabled or the respective methods are missing,
  C<JSON::XS> throws an exception.
  
  =back
  
  =head3 DESERIALISATION
  
  For deserialisation there are only two cases to consider: either
  nonstandard tagging was used, in which case C<allow_tags> decides,
  or objects cannot be automatically be deserialised, in which
  case you can use postprocessing or the C<filter_json_object> or
  C<filter_json_single_key_object> callbacks to get some real objects our of
  your JSON.
  
  This section only considers the tagged value case: I a tagged JSON object
  is encountered during decoding and C<allow_tags> is disabled, a parse
  error will result (as if tagged values were not part of the grammar).
  
  If C<allow_tags> is enabled, C<JSON::XS> will look up the C<THAW> method
  of the package/classname used during serialisation (it will not attempt
  to load the package as a Perl module). If there is no such method, the
  decoding will fail with an error.
  
  Otherwise, the C<THAW> method is invoked with the classname as first
  argument, the constant string C<JSON> as second argument, and all the
  values from the JSON array (the values originally returned by the
  C<FREEZE> method) as remaining arguments.
  
  The method must then return the object. While technically you can return
  any Perl scalar, you might have to enable the C<enable_nonref> setting to
  make that work in all cases, so better return an actual blessed reference.
  
  As an example, let's implement a C<THAW> function that regenerates the
  C<My::Object> from the C<FREEZE> example earlier:
  
     sub My::Object::THAW {
        my ($class, $serialiser, $type, $id) = @_;
  
        $class->new (type => $type, id => $id)
     }
  
  
  =head1 ENCODING/CODESET FLAG NOTES
  
  The interested reader might have seen a number of flags that signify
  encodings or codesets - C<utf8>, C<latin1> and C<ascii>. There seems to be
  some confusion on what these do, so here is a short comparison:
  
  C<utf8> controls whether the JSON text created by C<encode> (and expected
  by C<decode>) is UTF-8 encoded or not, while C<latin1> and C<ascii> only
  control whether C<encode> escapes character values outside their respective
  codeset range. Neither of these flags conflict with each other, although
  some combinations make less sense than others.
  
  Care has been taken to make all flags symmetrical with respect to
  C<encode> and C<decode>, that is, texts encoded with any combination of
  these flag values will be correctly decoded when the same flags are used
  - in general, if you use different flag settings while encoding vs. when
  decoding you likely have a bug somewhere.
  
  Below comes a verbose discussion of these flags. Note that a "codeset" is
  simply an abstract set of character-codepoint pairs, while an encoding
  takes those codepoint numbers and I<encodes> them, in our case into
  octets. Unicode is (among other things) a codeset, UTF-8 is an encoding,
  and ISO-8859-1 (= latin 1) and ASCII are both codesets I<and> encodings at
  the same time, which can be confusing.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item C<utf8> flag disabled
  
  When C<utf8> is disabled (the default), then C<encode>/C<decode> generate
  and expect Unicode strings, that is, characters with high ordinal Unicode
  values (> 255) will be encoded as such characters, and likewise such
  characters are decoded as-is, no changes to them will be done, except
  "(re-)interpreting" them as Unicode codepoints or Unicode characters,
  respectively (to Perl, these are the same thing in strings unless you do
  funny/weird/dumb stuff).
  
  This is useful when you want to do the encoding yourself (e.g. when you
  want to have UTF-16 encoded JSON texts) or when some other layer does
  the encoding for you (for example, when printing to a terminal using a
  filehandle that transparently encodes to UTF-8 you certainly do NOT want
  to UTF-8 encode your data first and have Perl encode it another time).
  
  =item C<utf8> flag enabled
  
  If the C<utf8>-flag is enabled, C<encode>/C<decode> will encode all
  characters using the corresponding UTF-8 multi-byte sequence, and will
  expect your input strings to be encoded as UTF-8, that is, no "character"
  of the input string must have any value > 255, as UTF-8 does not allow
  that.
  
  The C<utf8> flag therefore switches between two modes: disabled means you
  will get a Unicode string in Perl, enabled means you get an UTF-8 encoded
  octet/binary string in Perl.
  
  =item C<latin1> or C<ascii> flags enabled
  
  With C<latin1> (or C<ascii>) enabled, C<encode> will escape characters
  with ordinal values > 255 (> 127 with C<ascii>) and encode the remaining
  characters as specified by the C<utf8> flag.
  
  If C<utf8> is disabled, then the result is also correctly encoded in those
  character sets (as both are proper subsets of Unicode, meaning that a
  Unicode string with all character values < 256 is the same thing as a
  ISO-8859-1 string, and a Unicode string with all character values < 128 is
  the same thing as an ASCII string in Perl).
  
  If C<utf8> is enabled, you still get a correct UTF-8-encoded string,
  regardless of these flags, just some more characters will be escaped using
  C<\uXXXX> then before.
  
  Note that ISO-8859-1-I<encoded> strings are not compatible with UTF-8
  encoding, while ASCII-encoded strings are. That is because the ISO-8859-1
  encoding is NOT a subset of UTF-8 (despite the ISO-8859-1 I<codeset> being
  a subset of Unicode), while ASCII is.
  
  Surprisingly, C<decode> will ignore these flags and so treat all input
  values as governed by the C<utf8> flag. If it is disabled, this allows you
  to decode ISO-8859-1- and ASCII-encoded strings, as both strict subsets of
  Unicode. If it is enabled, you can correctly decode UTF-8 encoded strings.
  
  So neither C<latin1> nor C<ascii> are incompatible with the C<utf8> flag -
  they only govern when the JSON output engine escapes a character or not.
  
  The main use for C<latin1> is to relatively efficiently store binary data
  as JSON, at the expense of breaking compatibility with most JSON decoders.
  
  The main use for C<ascii> is to force the output to not contain characters
  with values > 127, which means you can interpret the resulting string
  as UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ASCII, KOI8-R or most about any character set and
  8-bit-encoding, and still get the same data structure back. This is useful
  when your channel for JSON transfer is not 8-bit clean or the encoding
  might be mangled in between (e.g. in mail), and works because ASCII is a
  proper subset of most 8-bit and multibyte encodings in use in the world.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 JSON and ECMAscript
  
  JSON syntax is based on how literals are represented in javascript (the
  not-standardised predecessor of ECMAscript) which is presumably why it is
  called "JavaScript Object Notation".
  
  However, JSON is not a subset (and also not a superset of course) of
  ECMAscript (the standard) or javascript (whatever browsers actually
  implement).
  
  If you want to use javascript's C<eval> function to "parse" JSON, you
  might run into parse errors for valid JSON texts, or the resulting data
  structure might not be queryable:
  
  One of the problems is that U+2028 and U+2029 are valid characters inside
  JSON strings, but are not allowed in ECMAscript string literals, so the
  following Perl fragment will not output something that can be guaranteed
  to be parsable by javascript's C<eval>:
  
     use JSON::XS;
  
     print encode_json [chr 0x2028];
  
  The right fix for this is to use a proper JSON parser in your javascript
  programs, and not rely on C<eval> (see for example Douglas Crockford's
  F<json2.js> parser).
  
  If this is not an option, you can, as a stop-gap measure, simply encode to
  ASCII-only JSON:
  
     use JSON::XS;
  
     print JSON::XS->new->ascii->encode ([chr 0x2028]);
  
  Note that this will enlarge the resulting JSON text quite a bit if you
  have many non-ASCII characters. You might be tempted to run some regexes
  to only escape U+2028 and U+2029, e.g.:
  
     # DO NOT USE THIS!
     my $json = JSON::XS->new->utf8->encode ([chr 0x2028]);
     $json =~ s/\xe2\x80\xa8/\\u2028/g; # escape U+2028
     $json =~ s/\xe2\x80\xa9/\\u2029/g; # escape U+2029
     print $json;
  
  Note that I<this is a bad idea>: the above only works for U+2028 and
  U+2029 and thus only for fully ECMAscript-compliant parsers. Many existing
  javascript implementations, however, have issues with other characters as
  well - using C<eval> naively simply I<will> cause problems.
  
  Another problem is that some javascript implementations reserve
  some property names for their own purposes (which probably makes
  them non-ECMAscript-compliant). For example, Iceweasel reserves the
  C<__proto__> property name for its own purposes.
  
  If that is a problem, you could parse try to filter the resulting JSON
  output for these property strings, e.g.:
  
     $json =~ s/"__proto__"\s*:/"__proto__renamed":/g;
  
  This works because C<__proto__> is not valid outside of strings, so every
  occurrence of C<"__proto__"\s*:> must be a string used as property name.
  
  If you know of other incompatibilities, please let me know.
  
  
  =head2 JSON and YAML
  
  You often hear that JSON is a subset of YAML. This is, however, a mass
  hysteria(*) and very far from the truth (as of the time of this writing),
  so let me state it clearly: I<in general, there is no way to configure
  JSON::XS to output a data structure as valid YAML> that works in all
  cases.
  
  If you really must use JSON::XS to generate YAML, you should use this
  algorithm (subject to change in future versions):
  
     my $to_yaml = JSON::XS->new->utf8->space_after (1);
     my $yaml = $to_yaml->encode ($ref) . "\n";
  
  This will I<usually> generate JSON texts that also parse as valid
  YAML. Please note that YAML has hardcoded limits on (simple) object key
  lengths that JSON doesn't have and also has different and incompatible
  unicode character escape syntax, so you should make sure that your hash
  keys are noticeably shorter than the 1024 "stream characters" YAML allows
  and that you do not have characters with codepoint values outside the
  Unicode BMP (basic multilingual page). YAML also does not allow C<\/>
  sequences in strings (which JSON::XS does not I<currently> generate, but
  other JSON generators might).
  
  There might be other incompatibilities that I am not aware of (or the YAML
  specification has been changed yet again - it does so quite often). In
  general you should not try to generate YAML with a JSON generator or vice
  versa, or try to parse JSON with a YAML parser or vice versa: chances are
  high that you will run into severe interoperability problems when you
  least expect it.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item (*)
  
  I have been pressured multiple times by Brian Ingerson (one of the
  authors of the YAML specification) to remove this paragraph, despite him
  acknowledging that the actual incompatibilities exist. As I was personally
  bitten by this "JSON is YAML" lie, I refused and said I will continue to
  educate people about these issues, so others do not run into the same
  problem again and again. After this, Brian called me a (quote)I<complete
  and worthless idiot>(unquote).
  
  In my opinion, instead of pressuring and insulting people who actually
  clarify issues with YAML and the wrong statements of some of its
  proponents, I would kindly suggest reading the JSON spec (which is not
  that difficult or long) and finally make YAML compatible to it, and
  educating users about the changes, instead of spreading lies about the
  real compatibility for many I<years> and trying to silence people who
  point out that it isn't true.
  
  Addendum/2009: the YAML 1.2 spec is still incompatible with JSON, even
  though the incompatibilities have been documented (and are known to Brian)
  for many years and the spec makes explicit claims that YAML is a superset
  of JSON. It would be so easy to fix, but apparently, bullying people and
  corrupting userdata is so much easier.
  
  =back
  
  
  =head2 SPEED
  
  It seems that JSON::XS is surprisingly fast, as shown in the following
  tables. They have been generated with the help of the C<eg/bench> program
  in the JSON::XS distribution, to make it easy to compare on your own
  system.
  
  First comes a comparison between various modules using
  a very short single-line JSON string (also available at
  L<http://dist.schmorp.de/misc/json/short.json>).
  
     {"method": "handleMessage", "params": ["user1",
     "we were just talking"], "id": null, "array":[1,11,234,-5,1e5,1e7,
     1,  0]}
  
  It shows the number of encodes/decodes per second (JSON::XS uses
  the functional interface, while JSON::XS/2 uses the OO interface
  with pretty-printing and hashkey sorting enabled, JSON::XS/3 enables
  shrink. JSON::DWIW/DS uses the deserialise function, while JSON::DWIW::FJ
  uses the from_json method). Higher is better:
  
     module        |     encode |     decode |
     --------------|------------|------------|
     JSON::DWIW/DS |  86302.551 | 102300.098 |
     JSON::DWIW/FJ |  86302.551 |  75983.768 |
     JSON::PP      |  15827.562 |   6638.658 |
     JSON::Syck    |  63358.066 |  47662.545 |
     JSON::XS      | 511500.488 | 511500.488 |
     JSON::XS/2    | 291271.111 | 388361.481 |
     JSON::XS/3    | 361577.931 | 361577.931 |
     Storable      |  66788.280 | 265462.278 |
     --------------+------------+------------+
  
  That is, JSON::XS is almost six times faster than JSON::DWIW on encoding,
  about five times faster on decoding, and over thirty to seventy times
  faster than JSON's pure perl implementation. It also compares favourably
  to Storable for small amounts of data.
  
  Using a longer test string (roughly 18KB, generated from Yahoo! Locals
  search API (L<http://dist.schmorp.de/misc/json/long.json>).
  
     module        |     encode |     decode |
     --------------|------------|------------|
     JSON::DWIW/DS |   1647.927 |   2673.916 |
     JSON::DWIW/FJ |   1630.249 |   2596.128 |
     JSON::PP      |    400.640 |     62.311 |
     JSON::Syck    |   1481.040 |   1524.869 |
     JSON::XS      |  20661.596 |   9541.183 |
     JSON::XS/2    |  10683.403 |   9416.938 |
     JSON::XS/3    |  20661.596 |   9400.054 |
     Storable      |  19765.806 |  10000.725 |
     --------------+------------+------------+
  
  Again, JSON::XS leads by far (except for Storable which non-surprisingly
  decodes a bit faster).
  
  On large strings containing lots of high Unicode characters, some modules
  (such as JSON::PC) seem to decode faster than JSON::XS, but the result
  will be broken due to missing (or wrong) Unicode handling. Others refuse
  to decode or encode properly, so it was impossible to prepare a fair
  comparison table for that case.
  
  
  =head1 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
  
  When you are using JSON in a protocol, talking to untrusted potentially
  hostile creatures requires relatively few measures.
  
  First of all, your JSON decoder should be secure, that is, should not have
  any buffer overflows. Obviously, this module should ensure that and I am
  trying hard on making that true, but you never know.
  
  Second, you need to avoid resource-starving attacks. That means you should
  limit the size of JSON texts you accept, or make sure then when your
  resources run out, that's just fine (e.g. by using a separate process that
  can crash safely). The size of a JSON text in octets or characters is
  usually a good indication of the size of the resources required to decode
  it into a Perl structure. While JSON::XS can check the size of the JSON
  text, it might be too late when you already have it in memory, so you
  might want to check the size before you accept the string.
  
  Third, JSON::XS recurses using the C stack when decoding objects and
  arrays. The C stack is a limited resource: for instance, on my amd64
  machine with 8MB of stack size I can decode around 180k nested arrays but
  only 14k nested JSON objects (due to perl itself recursing deeply on croak
  to free the temporary). If that is exceeded, the program crashes. To be
  conservative, the default nesting limit is set to 512. If your process
  has a smaller stack, you should adjust this setting accordingly with the
  C<max_depth> method.
  
  Something else could bomb you, too, that I forgot to think of. In that
  case, you get to keep the pieces. I am always open for hints, though...
  
  Also keep in mind that JSON::XS might leak contents of your Perl data
  structures in its error messages, so when you serialise sensitive
  information you might want to make sure that exceptions thrown by JSON::XS
  will not end up in front of untrusted eyes.
  
  If you are using JSON::XS to return packets to consumption
  by JavaScript scripts in a browser you should have a look at
  L<http://blog.archive.jpsykes.com/47/practical-csrf-and-json-security/> to
  see whether you are vulnerable to some common attack vectors (which really
  are browser design bugs, but it is still you who will have to deal with
  it, as major browser developers care only for features, not about getting
  security right).
  
  
  =head1 INTEROPERABILITY WITH OTHER MODULES
  
  C<JSON::XS> uses the L<Types::Serialiser> module to provide boolean
  constants. That means that the JSON true and false values will be
  comaptible to true and false values of iother modules that do the same,
  such as L<JSON::PP> and L<CBOR::XS>.
  
  
  =head1 THREADS
  
  This module is I<not> guaranteed to be thread safe and there are no
  plans to change this until Perl gets thread support (as opposed to the
  horribly slow so-called "threads" which are simply slow and bloated
  process simulations - use fork, it's I<much> faster, cheaper, better).
  
  (It might actually work, but you have been warned).
  
  
  =head1 THE PERILS OF SETLOCALE
  
  Sometimes people avoid the Perl locale support and directly call the
  system's setlocale function with C<LC_ALL>.
  
  This breaks both perl and modules such as JSON::XS, as stringification of
  numbers no longer works correctly (e.g. C<$x = 0.1; print "$x"+1> might
  print C<1>, and JSON::XS might output illegal JSON as JSON::XS relies on
  perl to stringify numbers).
  
  The solution is simple: don't call C<setlocale>, or use it for only those
  categories you need, such as C<LC_MESSAGES> or C<LC_CTYPE>.
  
  If you need C<LC_NUMERIC>, you should enable it only around the code that
  actually needs it (avoiding stringification of numbers), and restore it
  afterwards.
  
  
  =head1 BUGS
  
  While the goal of this module is to be correct, that unfortunately does
  not mean it's bug-free, only that I think its design is bug-free. If you
  keep reporting bugs they will be fixed swiftly, though.
  
  Please refrain from using rt.cpan.org or any other bug reporting
  service. I put the contact address into my modules for a reason.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Sub::Name - (re)name a sub
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.14
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
      use Sub::Name;
  
      subname $name, $subref;
  
      $subref = subname foo => sub { ... };
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module has only one function, which is also exported by default:
  
  =for stopwords subname
  
  =head2 subname NAME, CODEREF
  
  Assigns a new name to referenced sub.  If package specification is omitted in
  the name, then the current package is used.  The return value is the sub.
  
  The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).  You won't
  be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name.  To allow that, you need
  to do glob-assignment yourself.
  
  Note that for anonymous closures (subs that reference lexicals declared outside
  the sub itself) you can name each instance of the closure differently, which
  can be very useful for debugging.
