### Navigating FixMyStreet Pro as a staff user

<img alt="When you're logged in as an administrator the 'Admin' button is in the navigation menu" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/navigating-as-pro-staff.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

If your Administrator has already given you staff permissions, you will see an additional 'Admin' button on the top menu when you’re logged in. If not, your access may be only in the frontend (e.g. moderation does not require any backend admin access), or your Administrator can add these permissions at any time: see ‘[Creating a Staff Account](#adminstrating-staff-accounts)’.
</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="viewing-reports-your-area">

### Viewing all reports in your area

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: none</span>

If you want to view everything that’s been reported within your authority's boundary, click on ‘All reports’ in the top menu. You’ll see the boundaries of your authority area on the map, and a list of all reports, with the most recently updated reports at the top, in the left hand panel.

<img alt="Click all reports in the top menu to view all reports in an area" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/viewing-reports-your-area.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

<strong>Note:</strong> staff members can be allocated one or more category (eg potholes, streetlights, etc) by
an Administrator — see ‘[Creating a Staff Account](#adminstrating-staff-accounts)’ for more details. When logged in, these staff
members will <strong>only</strong> see reports within those categories by default.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="defining-area-interest">

### Defining the area of interest

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: none</span>

If required, you can use the controls to the right of the screen to zoom in or out, or pan across the map. As you’ll see, the list of reports and URL (web address) always reflect the area you are viewing on the map, so this is another way of refining your view.

Once you've found a satisfactory view, and if you are likely to want to revisit it, you can bookmark or otherwise take a copy of the URL displayed in your browser, so you don't have to define the location again in the future.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="view-report-specific-area">

### Viewing reports in a specific area

If you already know the street name or postcode of the location you’d like to view, you may find it quicker to use the search form on the front page. This will load the map at that location, along with a list of reports made there.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="filtering-sorting-reports">

### Filtering and sorting reports

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: none</span>

From the 'All reports' page, or after narrowing down on a specific area, you have the ability to filter reports using the drop-downs at the top of the left panel. 

<img alt="Use the drop-down menus to filter reports" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/Filtering reports.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

You can filter by state (eg ‘Fixed’ or ‘In progress’) and category (eg Potholes or Graffiti). You may also sort them by date
created, how recently they have been updated, or number of updates.

All categories, or all subcategories within a parent category, can be viewed via a toggle, making it easier and quicker to navigate to the reports in which you are interested.

Let’s say, for example, you want to view on the map all reports relating to parks maintenance issues, such as full litter bins, fly-tipping and path cleaning. Instead of having to manually select the relevant categories, you can instead select the parent category ‘Parks maintenance’ and all associated categories will be toggled. Once you’re done, click the parent category again to deselect all associated categories. 

Equally, if you want to view reports from all available categories, you can click ‘Everything’ at the top of the list to select all categories, and click again to deselect them all.

Click on ‘Admin’ in the top menu bar. 

<img alt="There are a number of different options for using the Search Reports box" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/Locating the admin button.png" class="-screenshot" />

You'll be taken to an admin summary page for your FixMyStreet Pro instance, from which you can search for reports. 

<img alt="There are a number of different options for using the Search Reports box" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/Search reports box.png" class="-screenshot" />

Using the 'Search Reports' box, you can:

- Enter any word contained in the required report’s title or body
- Search by the report-maker’s name (or part of the name), their email address or phone
    number (where given).
- Search by the report’s ID number if it’s known. Putting ‘id:’ directly before this number in
    the search box will speed up the return of results.
- Search by an ID number used within an integrated backend system. Prefix your search with "ref:" followed by the external ID. Note: this may depend on the system/set up of the integration.

The search will return a list of all reports that fulfil your parameters.

Depending upon the staff user’s permissions, you can then either click on the
report’s ID number to open the report in a new browser window and access the
moderation/ editing/ inspection facilities there; or click on the word ‘Edit’
to access the full report admin editing page.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="view-reports-non-staff-user">

### Viewing reports as a non-staff user

As a staff user, your view of a report includes moderation functions which ordinary users do not
see. If you would like to view a report as a member of the public would see it, there are three
options:

- Log out of FixMyStreet, or
- Start a [private browsing session](https://www.howtogeek.com/269265/how-to-enable-private-browsing-on-any-web-browser/), or
- View the page in a different browser to the one you are currently using, in which you are not logged in to FixMyStreet.

Any of these courses of action will allow you to view the site as an anonymous visitor, with no
recognition of your staff role.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="create-reports-behalf-user">

### Creating reports and updates on behalf of another user/the authority

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked
as staff; optionally, one or more of ‘Create reports/updates on a user's
behalf’, ‘Create reports/updates as anonymous user’ and ‘Create reports/updates
as the council’ can be ticked.</span>

If a member of the public makes a report or update by phone or in person, staff members
with the appropriate permissions can add it to FixMyStreet on their behalf. The
report will be anonymous on the site, but the resident’s name will still be
available in the admin interface. Reports can also be made as if from the
council or authority using FixMyStreet Pro.

Staff should make a new report just as a member of the public would — see ‘[The
citizen’s experience](/pro-manual/citizens-experience/)'. Those with the appropriate permissions will see a dropdown box in
the report-making interface, labeled ‘Report As’. Select either the council, ‘yourself’, ‘anonymous’ or
‘another user’.

<img alt="Staff users can select to report as another user" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/Reporting as another user.png" class="-screenshot" />

In order to reduce confusion for customer service staff, the email,
name and phone number fields in the reporting and update pages are
disabled for staff users. This avoids accidental overwriting of their
own details with those of e.g. citizens making reports over the
telephone in case staff forget to switch the ‘Report As’ control to
‘another user’.

If a user has the ‘Default to creating reports/update as the council’
permission then the dropdown will default to reporting as the council.
Staff with the ’Markup problem details’ permission will also default to
reporting as the council.

When a staff member makes an update on the site, it will not be publicly
displayed with the staff member’s name, but the name of the body to which the
user is attached. Staff members with the ‘See user detail for reports created
as the council’ permission will be able to see the staff user’s name on the
report or update, but other staff and the public will not.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="deal-undesirable-content">

### Dealing with undesirable content

Fortunately, abuse of FixMyStreet is fairly rare: undesirable content represents a tiny fraction of
the reports made each year. But of course, you need the tools to deal with it, and there are other
reasons you may wish to edit a report, too. 

#### Reasons for moderation

- **Personal information** ​such as the accidental inclusion of contact details in the report
body.
- **Potentially libelous content** ​such as complaints about illegal or anti-social behaviour
which implicate an identifiable individual.
- **Abusive content** ​such as profanity or unsuitable images.
- **Corrections** ​ - for example, a staff member may have added an update which they now wish to alter because of a
spelling mistake (if the report’s status has changed or a factual error was made, we
recommend a new update rather than editing an existing one).

We recommend a ‘light touch’ approach to editing, in which any content from a user, other than
those types listed above, is left intact. For example, there is no need to correct a report-maker’s
spelling or grammar unless they request that you do so.

#### Moderating reports

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; ‘moderate report details’ must be ticked.</span>

When logged in, staff with the required level of permissions can moderate reports directly on the
report webpage. You will see a ‘moderate’ button below the report’s main body, and above each
update. Clicking this button gives you the ability to:

- Edit the title or body text
- Remove a user’s name
- Remove, redact or restore photographs

<img alt="The ‘moderate’ button below the report’s main body" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/deal-undesirable-content.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

You can also add a note to indicate the reason for the change to the report.

Moderation history will be shown within the report updates, and is only visible to people with
the moderate permission.

#### Redacting photographs

When moderating, each photo has an associated “Redact” option. Selecting this
opens up the full size photo, on which you can draw black rectangles if you
need to hide a section of a photo without removing the entire photo.

<img alt="Photos can be redacted to hide a section" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/photo-redaction.jpeg" class="admin-screenshot">

#### Hiding reports

Clicking the moderation button also gives you the option to hide an entire report or its updates.
‘Hiding’ means that the report is no longer visible to the general public, but it remains in the site’s
database and is accessible to staff with admin permissions.

Once a report is hidden, staff without admin permissions can no longer access it — so if, for
example, they hide a report by accident and wish to revert it to public, they must contact a team
member with the appropriate permissions.

#### Removing users’ names

When users make a report on FixMyStreet, they may choose not to display their name on the
public web page. If a user accidentally chooses to display their name and then wishes to remove it,
they can do so themselves when logged in to FixMyStreet.

However, if necessary, council staff can also remove a name from a public report on behalf of the
user: see ‘[moderating reports](#deal-undesirable-content)’.

#### Adding a user to the abuse list

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff, ‘Edit users’ must be ticked.</span>

You can add an abusive user's email to the abuse list, which automatically hides any reports they
create, and means that their reports are not sent. Instead, the user sees a message that there was
an error in confirming their report.

Staff with the required permissions can ban a user directly from their user admin page, using the ‘Ban user’
button.

#### Removing users from the banned list

When a user has been banned, an ‘unban’ button will be visible on their user admin page. This
restores them to the status of a standard user, but it does not have any effect on reports which
were made during the period when the user was banned — these remain unsent.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="create-reports-private">

### Creating/viewing private reports

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked
as staff; one or more of ‘View/Mark private reports’ and ‘Markup problem
details’ must be ticked.</span>

If a you are creating a report that has to contain information that should
not be made public, such as names and addresses, then you can create a
Private report. 

In such cases, staff should make a new report just as a member of the public would — see ‘[The
citizen’s experience](/pro-manual/citizens-experience/)'. Those with the appropriate permissions
will see a "Private" checkbox underneath the user details which they should select.

<img alt="Checking the box marks a new report as private" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/Marking a report as private.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

You can also mark an existing report as private by visiting the report
page while logged in. Check the "Private" box in the top right of the blue admin panel and remember to click 'Save changes'.

<img alt="Checking the box marks an existing report as private" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/Marking an existing report as private.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

On the reports page you can select "Private only" from the status filter
to display only the reports that have been marked private.

<strong>Note:</strong> Private reports are still visible to staff members with the
relevant permissions and will be sent as normal but will <strong>not</strong> be visible
to members of the public.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="correct-reporter-errors">

### Correcting reporter errors

#### Changing a report’s category

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff, and ‘edit report category’ must be ticked.</span>

If the user has chosen the wrong category for their report, when logged in, staff with the appropriate permissions can change it from within the on-page editing interface, from the dropdown to the right of the report.

<img alt="Change the category of a report" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/change-category-report.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

If changing the category of the report results in it becoming the responsibility of another authority,
the report will be re-sent to that authority. Do not mark it as closed, even though you have now
dealt with it as far as your authority is concerned; from the other authority's point of view, and for
the person who made the report, the status is still open.

However, if the report remains your authority’s responsibility, the category change does not re-send
the report unless the send method has changed (e.g. in the case of councils where some reports are sent via the Open311 protocol and others by email).

#### Changing the location

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked
as staff; ‘Markup problem details’, ‘Edit report category’, or ‘Edit report
priority’ must be ticked</span>

- You can click and drag a pin at any time to change the report’s specified location.
- When viewing a report on the ground, staff with the appropriate permissions may click
‘set to my current location’. This will reset the co-ordinates of the issue to reflect a more accurate placement.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="keep-report-maker-informed">

### Keeping the report-maker informed

Updates can be left on a report in order to keep the creator of the report, and
the wider public viewing the site, informed on what is happening. 

<strong>Note:</strong> If you have an integration into a CRM, CM or asset management system, updates to users may be automated and not managed in the below way. This depends on how the integration is set up and how your organisation chooses to manage responses to reports.

Staff members can manually update the state of the report as and when necessary,
including states such as ‘in progress’ or ‘no further action’, plus leave a
textual update to explain in more detail.

Many issues require identical or very similar responses. Rather than type your reply out each time,
staff can choose from a number of pre-written (but editable) template responses, such as
‘Thank you for your report, we’ll be back in touch with an update soon’, ‘Repairs are now
underway’ and ‘This issue is now closed’.

#### Status updates

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff</span>

<img alt="Use a template to make public updates faster" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/report-public-update.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

From the report page, staff with the appropriate permissions may select from the ‘public update’
dropdown. This will prefill an update with template text for one of a number of common statuses.
The templates are created by the Administrator; see ‘[Creating response templates](#creating-editing-response-templates)’.

The text in template responses is fully editable on the report page, so staff may also choose to add
their own comments or edit the preformatted responses to reflect the precise circumstances of the
report. Alternatively they may write an entirely new status update.

In some cases, template responses are automatically attached to a report state — for example,
setting the report state as closed may automatically select the template ‘Issue closed’. See
‘creating a template’.

If ‘Create reports/updates as the council’ is ticked in the staff user’s account permissions, their
updates will be labeled as from the council rather than the staff member’s name. For the sake of
staff privacy, this is usually preferable.

Staff with appropriate permissions can also attach an image to the update, which will then be
displayed publicly alongside the text update.

This option is also available via the general 'Update' box under the main report.

<img alt="Updating the user via the report itself" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/Provide an update on a report.png
" class="admin-screenshot" />

#### Requests for more information

Depending on your preference, you may request more information by contacting the user directly,
or by leaving a status update on the report that asks for the details you need. Both will reach the
report-maker; the difference is that a status update can also be seen by anyone viewing the report
online.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="prioritising-tasks">

### Prioritising tasks

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff and ‘edit report priority’ or 'mark up problem

<img alt="Set a report priority from the report screen" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/report-change-priority.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

#### Setting a priority
From the panel on the right hand side of a report, staff with the appropriate permissions may
select a priority from a drop-down list. These priorities are created by Administrator-level users;
see ‘[Setting categories and priorities](#creating-editing-priorities) ’.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="working-with-shortlists">

### Working with shortlists

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff and ‘manage shortlist’ must be ticked.</span>

You can easily create a shortlist of reports that you need to inspect, and arrange them into the
order that suits you best. Once that’s done, you can consult them via a mobile device — even when
offline — or, if you prefer, print the list out on paper.

#### Making a shortlist

<img alt="Add reports to your shortlist by clicking the star icons" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/all-reports-shortlist.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

First, navigate to the ‘All reports’ page where you will see issues listed on the left. In most cases,
it’s useful to leave these in their default of ‘sort by newest’ so that you see the most recent reports
first, and to use the dropdown to filter the reports so that you only see those which have an ‘open’
status. You may also wish to limit your results to a specific category. See more about [filtering and
sorting reports](#filtering-and-sorting-reports).

Once this is done, you can add a report to your shortlist by clicking on the star beside it. The star
will turn green to indicate that it has been added. Click the stars by any report which you wish to
investigate.

At a certain level of zoom, there’s also the ability to ‘add all reports visible to shortlist’, which
allows you to make a bulk addition of everything within the area.

Alternatively, you may add a report from within the individual report page.
Adding a report to your own list will remove it from any other staff member’s list to which it has
previously been added.

<img alt="Add a report to your shortlist from within the individual report page" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/report-page-shortlist.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

#### Viewing, editing and sorting the shortlist

Click on ‘Shortlist’ in the top menu bar and you will see all the reports which you’ve selected.
You can continue to add more reports by returning to the ‘all reports’ page.

<img alt="View your shortlist from the link in the navigation bar" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/your-shortlist.png" class="admin-screenshot" />


If you wish to remove a report from your list, click on the green star again. This can be done on the
individual report’s page, from the ‘all reports’ page, or from within your shortlist.

Shortlists can be ordered and filtered in the same way as the main list, by using the dropdown
menus. You can also use the arrows beside each report title to move them up or down the list, until
they are in a practical order for your route or priorities.

#### Assigning reports to another user's shortlist

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff and 'Assign problem reports to users' must be ticked.</span>

Managers of teams of inspectors can assign reports to the shortlists of inspectors (i.e. staff with the 'Markup problem details' permission). The assignment dropdown appears when editing reports with the inspector tool, but only if there are any users available to be assigned.

Reports can also be assigned in bulk from the 'All reports' page, where inspector managers can see at a glance which reports are assigned to which inspectors.

Assigned users can also be viewed on the Reports list page in the Admin area, as well as when editing a report in that list by clicking its 'Edit' link.

#### Seeing which reports are assigned and unassigned

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff and 'Markup problem details' must be ticked.</span>

In addition to seeing their own shortlist, inspectors can, like inspector managers, see which reports are assigned to other inspectors, both in the individual report webpage and in the 'All reports' list.

#### Viewing navigation routes

From any report, you can click the button marked ‘navigate to this problem’. This will open a
separate tab in your browser, and plot a route on Google maps from your current location.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="viewing-editing-reports-offline">

### Viewing and editing reports offline

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff and ‘manage shortlist’ must be ticked.</span>

Sometimes it’s useful to be able to see and update reports even when you’re offline — perhaps in
areas with low mobile connectivity, or because you want to save data. FixMyStreet Pro will let you
do this, and then it syncs everything up when you’re back online.

Visit your shortlist page before you go out and about: you’ll see a message that the list is being
cached for use offline. That means that whenever you are viewing the page without an internet
connection, you’ll be able to see the reports — make sure you have the shortlist page bookmarked
so that you can find it when you need it.

While offline, you can view reports, create and edit updates. The changes will all go live once you
go online to sync.

#### Syncing

To synchronise your records once you're back online, just visit any page on FixMyStreet and click the prompt to submit your changes.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="adminstrating-staff-accounts">

### Administrating staff accounts

#### Creating a staff account

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; ‘Edit users’ details’ must be ticked.</span>

<img alt="From the user admin page you can administer staff accounts" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/user-admin-page.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

Go to the ‘Users’ tab in the admin menu.

You’ll see a table of existing users. Below this is the ‘add user’ interface.

First create the basic user account by inputting a name and email address, plus any other contact
details desired. Once this is done and you have saved the input, you can edit the account to assign
any roles or permissions required.

The 'Staff' checkbox cannot be unchecked; this guarantees a new user will be a staff user, and will be automatically assigned to the correct body.

The new staff user can then log in via the normal method.

#### Creating roles

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; ‘Edit other users' permissions must be ticked.</span>

Go to the ‘Roles’ tab in the admin menu.

Here you can create a group of permissions, called a ‘role’. See [Staff user
accounts](../staff-user-accounts/) for some possible examples, but you can use
whatever makes sense to your own organisation.

Once you have created a role, you can then assign a user to one or more roles
to give that user access to all the permissions of those roles, without having
to assign permissions individually for each user.

#### Assigning roles and permissions

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; ‘Edit other users' permissions must be ticked.</span>

<img alt="You can assign permissions to users on this screen" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/user-admin-permissions.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

Once you have created the basic staff user account, you’ll be taken to a page where you can assign
roles and permissions.

You can also always edit any user from the table at the top of the Users page by clicking ‘edit’.
Select the roles or permissions you wish that user to have, and click ‘submit changes’.


#### Setting categories to users and roles

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; ‘Assign users to areas’ must be ticked (for areas).</span>

<img alt="You can allocate categories to individual users by checking the relevant category boxes" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/user-admin-categories.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

The Administrator can allocate one or more categories of report (e.g. Potholes or Highways
maintenance) to a staff user by editing the user and checking the relevant category boxes. The
staff user, when logged in, will then only see reports within those categories. This is useful where a
staff user only deals with reports of a specific type.

Roles can also have categories associated with them. This works in the same way as assigning categories
to a user. You can assign categories to a role by editing the role and checking the relevant category
boxes. By default, users will then be shown a filtered list of categories relevant to their role. 

**Please note:** there is no restriction functionality to prevent users from seeing other categories by removing the default filter. However, this can be done if required by:

1. Ticking "Frontend staff access only to users assigned to this category" on a particular category page - this restricts the category, so that only staff assigned to that category will see staff-related features.
2. Ticking "Assigned categories only" on a user's page - this restricts that user to only see front end staff features in their assigned categories.

#### Removing staff status from accounts

To remove the staff status from an account visit the user page and
uncheck the ‘staff’ checkbox. To prevent a user from logging in uncheck
the ‘email verified’ checkbox.

You can do this in bulk on the Users screen by selecting the checkbox
next to the user's name on the users page, selecting the ‘Remove staff
permission’ checkbox and clicking submit.

Note that if a user has access to the email address associated with an
account they can re-enable their account, but will not have staff
permissions.

#### Removing accounts

To remove an account, the Administrator-level member of staff should make contact with SocietyWorks.

#### Two-factor authentication

Any staff user can choose to set up two-factor authentication on their account.
To do this, they will need an app on their phone that can generate time-based
authentication keys, such as Google Authenticator or a password manager. Then.
they can visit their account page on the site and select ‘Activate two-factor
authentication’ to receive a QR code to scan with the app.

If you wish your organisation to have mandated two-factor authentication,
please get in touch.

If your FixMyStreet Pro installation has been integrated with a CRM system,
this section might not fully apply; it is possible categories are managed from
within the CRM, and FixMyStreet will be set up to work with these. Some
installations only integrate on some categories, and some sections such as form
disabling can still be used on top of an integration.

<img alt="Control the categories the site displays when a report is made here" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/category-admin-page.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

#### Creating a category

Those with the appropriate permissions can dictate which categories the site displays when a
report is being made.

These categories also become one of the criteria by which all users — both members of the public
and staff users — can filter reports when viewing them on the site.

From the Admin menu, click on ‘Categories’. You’ll see a table of existing categories, and below
that, a form by which you can create new ones.

Input a title for the category, and the email address to which reports in that category should be
forwarded. When creating a category, these are the only fields required.

You can also choose a variety of options – whether to automatically hide any
reports made in this category, whether to prevent form submission when this
category is selected, whether updates are allowed on reports in this category,
whether members of the public can reopen fixed/closed reports in this category,
or what parent category or categories a particular category is in. See below
for information on <a
href="#creating-editing-notices">creating/editing extra notices and
questions</a> for a category.

You may also be able to configure categories to allow anonymous
reporting if you have this option available. If this is not available then
contact us to discuss it.

Categories can be made ‘staff only’, where they are only available to logged-in
members of staff, not members of the public. This could be used for e.g.
contact centre staff to leave reports in categories that you still want to be
phoned in.

Categories can be marked as a litter category for when the council is responsible
for litter on parts of a Highways England road. This will mean the category
will be included in the Highways England categories for any relevant stretch of road.

You can set up as many or as few categories as you like, and each category can have its own email
address attached to it, so for example, reports about potholes may go to one council email
address, while reports about road signs go to another. More than one category may share the
same email address, if required.

For the best user experience, categories should be limited to no more than 20, and should be fairly
broad — so for example, one category titled ‘Parking’ is better than several titled ‘Bad parking’,
‘Car parks’, ‘Parking meters’, etc — especially if all the reports end up in the same mailbox. Fewer
and broader categories ensure better accuracy in the routing of reports that you receive, as it is
easier for a user to identify the correct one.

Category titles should, as far as possible, use language that residents of all levels of experience or
education are likely to understand, rather than internal council or highways management jargon
(such as ‘paths’ rather than ‘footways’ and ‘roads’ rather than ‘carriageways’ or even ‘highways’).
We always recommend the inclusion of one category titled ‘Other’, for reports which do not fit into
any pre-existing category. This should route emails to a general mailbox from where a member of
staff can forward them to the most suitable destination.

#### Editing categories

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; “Add/edit problem categories” must be
ticked.</span>

<img alt="You can edit categories using the edit category interface" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/edit-category-page.png" class="admin-screenshot" />


You can edit categories at any time by clicking on their title within the table at the top of the
Categories page.

From here, you can change the email address that the reports in this category are routed to,
or any of the other options for the category, such as the hint text shown to the user for
this category, whether reporting should be disabled when this category is selected, or
whether updates should be disabled on reports in this category.

### Creating and editing category notices and questions

<div class="boxout" markdown="1">

#### Note

If your FixMyStreet Pro installation has been integrated with a CRM system, some of this
section may not apply, e.g. extra questions may be pulled directly from the backend.

</div>

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; “Add/edit problem categories” must be
ticked.</span>

Each category can have additional notices and questions associated with it, called “Extra data”.
You can add as many as necessary (though we do recommend as few as possible, to stop people
being put off from filling in your form), reorder them, and update them. No extra data answers
are shown in public by default.

<img alt="Control the extra notices and questions the site displays when a report is made in this category"
    src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/edit-category-notice.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

#### Notices

A notice is some text that is displayed to the user when the category is
selected. This can be used to provide extra information about the category,
point specific cases elsewhere (e.g. a phone number for urgent enquiries), or
anything else you think the reporter may find useful.

##### HTML content in notices

Sometimes it can be helpful to use different text formatting or include images
in the notices shown to users. You could, for example, include photos that
illustrate the sorts of issues users should report in a particular category.

<img alt="Screenshot illustrating how the notice can include guidance for the user as well as a comparison photo."
    src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/blocked-drains-guidance.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

The **Notice text** field allows you to include HTML tags to apply text
formatting, add links, or include images in the notice shown to the user. The
above notice was generated from this HTML:

```html
We take different action depending on how a drain is blocked.<br>

<span style="font-weight: normal">A blockage on the surface of a drain could be caused by leaves or litter. These blockages can usually be cleared by carrying out street sweeping.</span><br>

<img src="https://www.borsetshire.gov.uk/images/BlockedDrainExamples.jpeg" alt="Compared with a surface blockage, an internal blockage could be caused by leaves, mud, or stones and need specialist equipment.">

```

The following HTML tags are allowed for use:

 - `p`
 - `ul`
 - `ol`
 - `li`
 - `br`
 - `b`
 - `i`
 - `strong`
 - `em`
 - `a`
   - The following attributes are allowed: `href`, `style`, `target="_blank"`, `title`
 - `img`
   - The following attributes are allowed: `src`, `alt`, `width`, `height`, `hspace`, `vspace`, `align`, `sizes`, `srcset`
   - **NB** The `alt` attribute is required if you're giving information only present in the image.
 - `span`
   - The following attributes are allowed: `style`

Any other tags or attributes not allowed by the above list will be stripped out
when you save your changes on the form.

#### Questions

A question can ask the user to provide some specific additional information
that you require in order to treat the problem appropriately, such as what
specific type of issue is being reported, or some additional details you
require to take the report forward. It can either be a free-text field, or a
drop-down, where you can specify the options to be picked from.

You can also selectively disable the form submission process based upon a
drop-down question answer - for example, if you had a question asking if the
situation was dangerous, you could disable the form if the reporter answered
Yes and display a message asking the user to ring a number instead.

#### Hidden/internal data fields

As well as questions and notices, you can set up hidden and internal data
fields.  A hidden data field will be output in the reporting form HTML (so e.g.
clicking on a map asset could fill this field with the asset’s ID), whereas an
internal data field is not output in the HTML (this is for special fields that
your server knows to accept, e.g. different co-ordinate systems, special
handling of textual input, and so on).

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="creating-editing-priorities">

### Creating and editing priorities

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; “Add/edit response priorities” must be ticked.</span>

Priorities indicate the relative urgency or importance of a report. You can set them to reflect your
own internal prioritisation system; there’s also space to add priority codes to comply with external
services that reports may be passed on to.

<img alt="Set your priorities to reflect your organisations needs" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/response-priority-screen.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

#### Create a new priority
Click on ‘Priorities’ in the admin menu. You will see any existing priorities listed in a table. Click
‘New priority’ to add a new one, then provide the following details:

- **Name** ​Give the priority a name which will be recognisable when it is being chosen from a
    dropdown list within a report, e.g. ‘High priority’.
- **Categories** ​ Priorities can be applied to one or more category of report: check the boxes to
    indicate which categories.
- **Description** ​ Include a description of the priority, e.g. ‘Four hour fix’.
- **External ID** ​ Any code that needs to be passed on to external contractors or services.
**- Default priority** ​Tick the box if this priority applies to all reports by default.

#### Edit an existing priority
Click on ‘Priorities’ in the admin menu. You will see any existing priorities listed in a table. Click
‘edit’ to make changes to an existing priority, and change any of the following, as required:

- **Name** ​ The identifier which appears, to staff with the appropriate permissions, in the
dropdown menu within a report.
- **Categories** ​ Priorities can apply to one or more category of report: check the boxes to
indicate which categories.
- **Description** ​ Include a description of the priority, e.g. ‘four hour fix’.
- **External ID** ​ Any code that needs to be passed on to external contractors or services
**- Default priority** ​Tick the box if this priority applies to all reports by default. If you check
this box, it will override any existing default priorities.
- **Flag as deleted** ​ Removes the priority from the system so that it can no longer be applied
to reports.

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="creating-editing-response-templates">

### Creating and editing response templates

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff; “Add/edit response templates” must be ticked.</span>

<img alt="You can create and edit pre-written responses on the response templates screen" src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/response-template-screen.png" class="admin-screenshot"/>

Staff users with the appropriate permissions may create and edit pre-written responses, so that
they can be applied to reports quickly and easily.

#### Creating a template

Click on ‘Templates’ in the admin menu. You will see a table of any existing templates. Click on the
button below, marked ‘New template’.

Common template responses deal with statuses such as: Report received; Scheduled for
inspection; Not council responsibility; Scheduled for repair; Work underway; Unable to fix;
Re-opened; and Resolved.

There is no limit to the number of template responses you can create.
When creating templates, you should consider:
- What are the most common response types that you send back to report makers? It may
be worth examining recent responses to find out.
- How should you word your response template text to make it as easy as possible for the
report maker to understand the status of their issue?
- What title should you give the template so that it can be easily identified from a drop-down
list when it is being applied by staff users?

Input a title and some text for your template, then set which categories it should apply to. You may
create different templates for each category, or use the same templates across multiple
categories.

You can also set a State so that the template response is automatically used when that state is
applied to a report.

For example, you can set it so that when a staff user changes a report’s state to ‘No further action’,
the ‘Resolved’ status update text is automatically applied. While this functionality can be a
time-saver, we advise using it with caution to ensure that the template text is applicable to every
situation in which is will be automatically applied.

If you have an Open311 connection, you can click ‘auto-response’ so that a
template will be applied when the state is updated by the automated Open311
process. In this instance, if your Open311 server returns extra text as part of
the update, you may put the placeholder `{% raw %}{{description}}{% endraw %}` in the template here,
and that placeholder will be replaced by the text from the Open311 server.

If you don’t have an Open311 connection, or your Open311 connection does not
provide an immediate initial update, there is a special case where if a
template is assigned to the Open state, and marked as ‘auto-response’, then it
will automatically be added as a first update to any new report created that
matches the template (ie. in the relevant category if assigned). This lets
you give e.g. estimated timescales or other useful information up front.

If you enter text in the ‘Text for email alert field’, the template text will update
the report on the website and the email text will be sent to the user if they have
opted into alerts. Otherwise the email text will be the same as the template text
that has updated the report.



#### Editing or deleting a template

Click on ‘Templates’ in the admin menu. You will see a table of existing templates. Click on ‘Edit’
beside the status you wish to change. You may alter any of the fields as described in the section
above, ‘Creating a template’. Additionally you can delete the template from this page.


#### HTML content in templates

HTML tags are permitted in response templates, which makes it possible to include
hyperlinks or rich text formatting in the updates which are added to reports.

Be aware that response templates are emailed to users as well as being shown on
the site, so it's best to keep any HTML formatting quite light-touch due to the
quirks of email clients' rendering of HTML message.

Refer to the section ["HTML Content in notices"](#html-content-in-notices) above for details of
what tags and attributes are allowed.

</div>

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="view-statistics">

### Viewing statistics

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff</span>

When you log in to the Admin area and click Stats in the admin navigation,
you’ll see some top-level statistics, including the number of reports published
on the site, the number of updates, and the number of alerts set up. This can
be useful for a quick snapshot of activity.

For a more detailed breakdown, visit the stats dashboard. This can be accessed
by going to "Summary statistics" from the admin stats page, or by typing
‘/dashboard’ on the end of your FixMyStreet url.

From here, you can access statistics on:

- All reports made across the council area
- Reports made within any specific ward or wards
- Reports made within any specific category
- Reports made between specific dates
- Reports that have a specific status, eg ‘open’ or ‘fixed’
- A combination of the above.

You can also group the results by:

- Category
- State
- Category and state
- Month
- Device (this allows you to see how many people access your site via the website, via an
Android device or via an iOS device).

These statistics can be downloaded as a CSV document, suitable for use in a spreadsheet program
such as Excel or your own reporting tools.

#### Importing dashboard data automatically

You may wish to automatically import data from the dashboard into your system on a regular basis.
Once you set your chosen criteria on the dashboard page, make a note of the URL of the "Reports"
or "Updates" link in the "Export as CSV" section.
Then you should generate an access token by visiting your account page and then "Security" and
generating a token from there.

You can then specify that token either by appending it to the URL as an `access_token` parameter,
or including it as an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` HTTP header in the request from your system.

The `export` must be present in the URL, and controls how the CSV is generated.
Reports can take some time to generate, so there are two different values for the parameter:

 - `export=1`: the response will wait until the file is ready and then provide it
 - `export=2` (the default): you will immediately get a 202 HTTP response with a redirect to the location where the file will be once it has finished processing. This is more robust.

#### Heatmap

Also accessible from the admin stats page is our heatmap. This can provide an
overview of reporting in your area, filtered by state, category, or ward, for a
particular date range:

<img alt="Screenshot of Bromley heatmap showing clusters in the north and north west."

<div class="admin-task" markdown="1" id="site-message">

### Displaying a site message

<span class="admin-task__permissions">Permissions required: User must be marked as staff and ‘Add/edit site message’ must be ticked.</span>

This feature allows you to set site messages which will be displayed on
the homepage or reporting pages; you can have different messages for in/out of hours.

Certain HTML tags can be used for formatting purposes. These are limited to the same set as described
in ["HTML content in notices"](#html-content-in-notices). You should not use block-level HTML elements
(e.g. `div`,`p`, etc) in the input field, as linebreaks are automatically converted to HTML tags. If
you want multiple paragraphs they should be separated with blank lines as in the below example.

To clear the message simply delete any contents in the box.

<img alt="The HTML text entered in to the box will be rendered on the homepage."
    src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/site-message-editing.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

<img alt="A site message can be shown to users on the FixMyStreet homepage."
    src="/assets/img/pro-user-guide/site-message-example.png" class="admin-screenshot" />

You can set the time periods that will count as out of hours on the same page. For example,
if your out of hours were 6pm to 8am Monday to Friday, all day weekends and Bank Holidays,
plus Christmas Eve, you would set it up as the following screenshot:

<img alt="Saturday, Sunday, Bank Holidays, and a special Christmas Eve, 00:00-24:00; Monday to Friday 00:00-08:00 and 18:00-24:00."
