# Administrator tasks

If you find that you cannot perform any of the tasks detailed below when logged into your FixMyStreet account, it is likely that your account has not been given the relevant permissions.

Contact your account administrator to request these permissions. Accompanying each task covered in this document, you will see ‘permissions required’, listing the checkboxes an Administrator must tick on your account for you to be able to perform this task.
