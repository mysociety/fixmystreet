# Administrator tasks

This section of the manual is designed to help you navigate the many different features and functionality available to staff users of FixMyStreet Pro. There's a lot to cover here, so take your time to read through. 

## Important notice

This guide provides a **general overview** of each of FixMyStreet Pro's standard features. There may be small differences in how the software functions for different authorities, depending on how you use the service, the integration(s) you have selected, and the individual processes reflected in your workflow.

Please speak to your Administrator if you have questions about functionality not covered specifically in the below guidance. If you are the Administrator and you need extra help, please open a ticket on Freshdesk.
