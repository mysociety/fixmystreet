# Administrator tasks

If you find that you cannot perform any of the tasks detailed below when logged
into your FixMyStreet account, it is likely that your account has not been
given the relevant permissions or role.

Contact your account administrator to request these permissions. Accompanying
each task covered in this document, you will see ‘permissions required’,
listing the permissions an Administrator must give you (either individually or
via a role) for you to be able to perform this task.

### Further help

- If you’re a member of council staff using FixMyStreet Pro, questions should first be addressed
to your Administrator.
- For any technical problems and queries, Administrators may contact the
  SocietyWorks team by raising a ticket through the helpdesk system.
